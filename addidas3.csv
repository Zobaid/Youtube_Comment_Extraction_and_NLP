Yo! The adidas Ultra Boost is now on sale for $126 on 6 colorways!! Link in description to buy from adidas!
I don't need reasons...I need money 🤣
Adidas should treat this shoes as classics like Stan Smith or Superstar. So we can buy a pair of Ultraboost even in 20 years
I’ve had Nike’s my whole life. Just recently I purchased my first ultra boost and I was blown away. Found myself smiling randomly 50 steps in.
Cop some groceries
"I don't care about the hype, they're so damn comfy and look nice with so many outfits."
“Go to the grocery store and cop some groceries”
Black out the boost
You should def paint it black man. It will look sick with black laces too! I wish i could buy atleast 1 ultraboost but here in Brasil its too expensive!
Bought my first pair this year and they are amazing
"Buy my first pair 
Me: ok ok pretty nice 
1 year later me: wow I have 13 pairs of ultra boost where do I put the
And it’s true"
"I remember I didn't like the ultraboost at first. I didn't like how they were running shoes, and all I would wear were Jordans, Vanz, and  Converse. But when I went to the store and bought me my first pair of ultraboost I couldn't believe how comfortable they were, and they were so easy to style them. We all have different feet so not everyone will like how they feel, and that's just how things are. I wore mine like crazy for the first week and than when i wore one of my Jordans I could feel the difference. You should give them a try"
They are so worth it just trust
"I have a ton more fun Top 5 Tuesday videos that will continue next week, stay tuned!"
i saved up for the 4.0 cookies and cream. My favorite shoe I have right now! Reccomend to anyone
"I just bought my first adidas Ultraboost this week, it should arrive tomorrow. I'm very excited."
"Im a distance runner in track and these are the best running shoes Ive ever felt. A1 impact protection, all of my injuries went away in a week of running in them. no stability issues. simply the goat"
Coped these for 20k in India yesterday and still fascinated they’re just phenomenal I tried the epic react to but the knit material is just perfect on Ultraboost and the boost is as always litt🔥🔥 best colourway
bought multiple pairs worth every penny
"""cop"" some groceries had me rolling"
"I purchased my first ultraboost in January 18, thanks to a sale @Heskicks pointed out... Good look! Lol ok so I have a couple things I wanted to address. 
1. It's comfortable but not the most comfortable shoes on the market. Love how lightweight they are, the primeknit is above my expectations, but the boost honestly doesn't seem more comfortable than my lunarglide 6/7s. Maybe I need to break the boost in more. "
"Just bought my first pair of Ultra Boost today, Hell yeah, so comfortable for everyday wear. Well worth the money..."
"Adidas ultra boosts are amazing,I’ve already bought 3 pairs and love them and just ordered a new pair of 4.0s"
"The ultra boost is great! I have 3 pairs lol.  The ""classic (2018) model, all terrain (also 2018), and the new 19's, or 2.0's. (the 2019 model or the complete redesign model)"
#1 reason people don’t buy
bought my 1st pair back in 2016 and still use them in 2019 lol I remember being hesitant back then because of the price but now im looking to buy another in all black for indoor running xD worth it.
"Purchased my first pair 3 days ago, and I wanted to get my second pair ALREADY...."
I bought my first adidas in December and as of today I have hit 20 🤷🏻‍♂️😊
Goat has the best prices for them I copped triple white for 110 dollars it’s insane
"I bought these a week ago, they are still comfy even though I wear them to death. Cop these now they feel amazing while being a beautiful sneaker. That’s rare."
"Just got ultraboost x game of thrones Stark, absolutely love them, 
The attention to detail is amazing."
I love the lacing you did on these🔥👌
1 year now since i bought my 1 ultraboost since then i end up 50pairs of boost now and i love boost specially yeezy and humanrace
"I went to the store to try em on, and left with a pair. Best shoe purchase I've made by far!"
bought my first pair of ub mid last month and rocking it almost everyday since then my feet thanked tf outta me so yeah ill be buying more of them in the future
"Black out the boost!!!!, It was nice meeting you for the second time bro. Loved the video... btw I play b ball at that court you present those ultra boost at all the time. Keep it up👌💪👍👍"
When I personally got my first I was skeptical of the price. But when I tried them on they were SO comfortable. Plus very stylish. I recommend anyone to get these
"Awesome video, Good Sir! Love how you didn’t even talk about it from a hype perspective, since I think Ultraboosts are great, hyped or not. I recommend them to people I know every time."
I've run 2 marathons and 3 times a week for a year and a half in a pair of ultra boosts and they are still going strong. Unparalleled comfort and tbh worth every penny.
I just came back from the store. I bought me this exact same pair. I'm going to take them for a 8 mile run tomorrow morning. I'm really looking forward to it. #boostislife
"Great video! I bought my first pair (mocha) and I fell in love with them. I since then have all of the parely ultra boost collection, black with white stripes dna ultra boost, and just did another order for the core black ultra boost!! Defenity recommend them to anyone. Finally quick question, where did you buy the laces for the ultra boost and what size?"
It's the most comfy shoes I have ever worn. Now I can keep up with my wife when she's on her shop till you drop mode.
"I bought my first pair of 4.0s a while back (after watching one of your videos ofcourse) and recently got another pair in Legend Ink! 
But tbh, I love wearing my inikis so so so much too! Got two pairs of those as well! I urge folks to try both.. 😁👌🏻"
You saying “dot O” kills me man
i just got the ultraboost parely lacless and they are very comfortable and is so awesome! never will regret it! #boostislife
I bought my first pair of ultraboost about a week ago and im in love! Super comfortable i didnt believe people at first but im surprised lol. Ive been sleeping on these for too long. 🙄
"I got my 1st pair about 3 months ago, Great looking shoe , very comfy , only thing is I had to take out insole because its a narrow shoe. I dont even have a wide foot but It felt much better no insole. Overall I would say im happy"
The ultraboost was so comfortable and felt so fast even when I was just jogging
"I’m a die hard Nike sneakerhead for as long as I can remember. I just recently tried on my first pair of Ultra Boost 4.0’s and quickly fell in love with the shoe. It is just as comfortable if not more than my Nike Flyknit Racers.  Keep in mind , however, that  I have flat and wide feet and wear a size 9.5 in all my Nike shoes. For the Ultra Boost, I had to go up a full size (Size 10.5). As of today, I now have 3 pairs of Ultra Boost and looking to build up a collection. 👍🏼"
"love boost, used to war nike but switched over to boost, have my 2nd pair now. anyway, i still wear my adidas originals as well, jist love superstar shoes... but boost is the best"
i bought my first ultraboost and its amazing i love the design of the 5th anniversary ultraboost
I just bought e pair yesterday and I’ve only wore them once and I love them they are comfortable and definitely worth the 180 dollars which I was skeptical of but I’m glad I bought them
I dont have much money but i really like these so i went on stockx and stole them for 80
"have about 7 pairs of ultra boost and ever since i got my first pair i never looked back. NMDs are comfy too, but nothing compared to ultraboost. Have uncaged and caged ones and theyre equally as comfortable in my opinion. Yes 180 is a high price, but once you try a pair on itll change the way you view every other brand. Got the miadidas 2.0 otw. #boostislife"
"the ub laceless is really underrated imo, it's very comfortable since there's no cage or laces and it fits like a compression sock #boostislife"
Just got my first pair yesterday and I absolutely love em! I could never see myself spending 180 on a pair of shoes but I tried them on and was blown away. Most comfortable shoes I’ve ever worn by far!
2:35 Whats The Name of The Colourway?
"Honestly just buy it, it’s so good! Feels so good when you wear it, and it is so stretchy, buy it, it’s worth it"
"Really really love the ultra boost! Wore several boost, this new one just another level!"
"nobody:
absolutely no one:
Hes: one dot O"
I just got my first pair of pure boosts and wow. I keep smiling as I walk. They’re perfect
I want them so badly but they’re very expensive ;-; Where I live they cost around 140-180€. Are they really worth that much?
"You buy them, you love them, and now it’s your main everyday shoe."
"I'm running the adidas ultra boost, and it feels like you're running on clouds! I do not want to take off the sneakers anymore."
“Cop groceries” 🤣
"Great video,the ONLY draw back of a UB is keeping the boost itself clean. Black out the boost on the oreo2. ANOTHER ONE! GO HES GO !!"
"Awesome vid’ champ, I pretty much can’t wear any other shoes, enough said 👌🏼"
"If I ever need a review of a shoe, I always go to your channel"
"I just bought the ultra boost as a running shoe, and I was contemplating it because it looks so damn nice. But I need a running shoe and I will not enjoy getting these beauties dirty."
"Hey man, just a small detail to highlight. The Ultra Boost was launch 3 years ago in Feb 2015. Boost was launch 5 years old in Feb 2013. And Yes Boost is life."
"Bought my first one in the form of a Grey 4.0, super hyped and happy to finally own one"
BEST PURCHASE OF 2019... FIRST ULTRABOOST. HAPPY WITH IT!!!
worth every penny ! got my first pair recently and no regrets
"Copped cloud white 4.0 yesterday and I love them I posted on my insta of me wearing them instantly lol

Edit: I love them so much"
I’ve never paid retail for ultra boost :) thank you DOD discount
"So Ultra boost, Boost, cloudfoam, or bounce?"
"Hes Kicks

What is your height pls"
Those are the same exact ultraboosts I have.
"i really cant afford them, although i want to lmao"
I love them! Feel great on the foot 🦶
Ultra Boosts are the best shoes to bless my feet. Also had some EQT Support 93/17 with the boost soles which were super comfy as well.
"Bought my first pair a few weeks ago. Since then I have bought 2 more, they are super comfortable and go with almost every outfit or activity. I really love the prime knit and how you can wear them all day with no foot pain."
“Cop some groceries”
When I bought the shoes I felt broke as hell but it was a amazing shoes.
"Man I love my ultra boost! They are the most comfortable sneakers I own. They are very stylish, great sneaker."
"So good I bought 2 in a month I do recommend getting some sort of shoe cleaner however, because they can get dirty quick."
I have a wide foot and love style. UBs are perfect.  I even love the ATR and think it's a vastly underrated shoe. You can rock them in the rain and they are incredible.
Wonderful review. Been looking at this shoes for workout/running
"""one datoe.. two datoe.. three datoe.. four datoe"""
Great videos bro!!
"Great perspective sir, I have yet to try a pair but am always looking. Keep it up"
"The recent Cookies & Cream is my 1st UB, love it! 👍🍪"
I love the aesthetics and they’re so comfortable
"Why is he calling its
-“three dot oh” 
-“four dot oh” 
Its sounds super wrong my dude"
"I bought mine yesterday on discount for 80 bucks, one of the greatest sneakers i've ever tried!"
Going on my third pair tried it once and fell in love no other shoe has topped this
You won’t regret buying this “purchase”😂
These shoes are AMAZING!  I bought the sneakers yesterday and I dont regret doing it. Sorry for my bad english
"I bought my first pair 5 months ago, I loved the feel. I never felt like I looked stupid. I just bought my second pair. I have a red and now a black and white pair. I can 100% recommend them"
"I’ve got NMD’s, EQT 93/17s, PODs, and now, my favorite, the ultra boost 4.0 NYC, which I just got today. The hype over the last half a decade is real"
"Man, this shoe had made me learn a lot about sneakers and sneakers market. it is by far the best shoe I ever tried. 10/10,  it deserves all the money"
Bro don't judge but I've never wore ultra boost. I didn't even need to watch the vid i already knew they was mad comfortable.
"I'm going to go on a trip soon , and I'm finaly going to try on a par of Ultra Boosts and I might cope a par"
Multicolor ultraboosts are my favorite shoes to wear when im buying fruit loops.
The sole on my 2.0 cracked in several spots after a year. Most comfortable shoe ever though.
"You KNOW I love Nike... But... I tried my first pair of ultraboost finally this January and bought my second pair shortly after! Insanely comfortable, it is hard for me to wear other shoes now... I must admit tho, I still don't like the $180 price tag but I got both of my pairs on sale for under $130 each!.."
Today I just bought my ultra boost 4.0  Parley it's my first time buying a 2 hundred something shoes
I am onto my second pair and honestly the comfiest shoe I have ever worn. Fantastic for both short and long distance. Recently bought nike pegasus and although they are comfy I think my next pair will 100% be the boosts.
"Picked up 2 the other day, there great. Also put picked up an exclusive pair of NMD r1s and these compare to NMDs are like walking on clouds."
"Tomorrow, i'm about to get my 1st ultra boost. Hopefully its worth the money & like what everybody claims."
"just bought my first pair of ultra boosts, half price i love them"
I just bought the same ones that he has in the video and omg it’s too good. It’s comfortable asf and great quality. Kinda wish it was in sale tho cause i wanted a pair of vans as well but I’m not trying to go bankrupt. But overall this show is worth it!
"I have heard ""#BoostisLife"" because i am a car guy aswell lol"
"Got my first pair for my birthday a month ago, already bought 2 other pairs. #Ultraboost love the videos"
"I honestly love the Ultraboost but when it comes to long term comfort, I would take my Nike Epic Reacts anyday"
I tried buying one pair and love it. Ended up buying another recently.
1:04 lmao 😂 dead he said COP GROCERIES
Black em out bro! I just copped and was thinking of doing the same. Great vid
"bro ive bought a pair, just waiting for them."
"i saw a pair at the shop so i tried them on , then i went home and ordered a pair straight away"
"""cop some groceries"""
is this shoe kinda.. uh .. secure and durable/stong/good for your ankles? i have the nike free rn 2018 right now and they are way to thin on the side (the reason for my sprained ankle)
Those are so good I have a pair of ultraboost feels like walking at clouds
Love it! But! Take a higher size that you have!
Holy crap just got some today from the mall AMAZING like I’m walking on air and it’s so roomy on my feet
I’m new to the sneaker game so my first ever limited release was the last triple black 3.0 and it’s honestly the best pair of trainers I’ve ever owned
Just bought mine yesterday. Could literally feel it mould around my feet not forgetting that slight bounce sensation with each step. Definitely a step up from the Pureboost.
"Bought the Ultraboost, my feet are to wide even after going up a 1/2 size. Ended up getting the Ultraboost ST which you suggested. Absolutely perfect shoes, except for the color ways."
"I have 3 pairs of ultra boost but different models
And shape and they are amazing and comfy to run in they feel like clouds each time you take a step"
I bought the 5th anniversary ultra boost and I love them!!!
Great in-depth review cheers. Subscribed 😎
"Still funny how you bash Nike for using the same midsole on the AirMax 2017 as they did on the 2016 yet it's ok for Adidas to use the same midsole on the UBs for 5 years straight.

Also, I personally regret buying the UB for 1 reason: The stupid plastic toeguard on the INSIDE of the shoe. But I'm one of a few with a problem with that stupid thing. I guess most people won't regret it. But be aware, maybe you're one of the 1% and feel that toeguard constantly. ;)"
"Never cared about shoes. But I when I got these, I got obssessed. Also, got a lot of compliments on them"
1:15 “you will not regret buying this purchase”
I run on the treadmill I heard these were great for running
"Will try a pair, soon as I destroy my new Yeezys, and Nike’s...."
I just bought ub. First impression of me wearing the shoes is meh. I dont know why. Do boost need to break down or what? It not as i expected. I tried lunar epic 2 it so comfortable. But ub i did not get that feeling. Im sorry. It's just my opinion
"just bought my first pair, and they are these CW"
"Great video. Hes, your descriptions and pleasure in the UB are one of the main reasons I decided to try them, in addition to how dope they look. I've always been a big Adidas originals fan, but in recent years got more into Jordans as I was in a better spot to spend money on sneakers... Anywho at your recommendation I bought my first UB not quite a year ago and now it's just about all I want. I've added at least 12 pair to my collection... My favorite models are the 3.0 and 4.0, and the 4.0 in some colorways are my favorite, while I don't like the pattern on some of the 4.0's due to the way the colors stitched change the appearance of it. I like the solid colors as well as the triple black and these joints in the video are amazing as well. I agree to anyone on the fence, you will not be disappointed..."
Best 4.0 colorway imo! So dope!
you won't regret buying this purchase.  lol
I've got the white non dyed and I love them😍
They are so good I completely recommend
1 reason why I can't: expensive and broke.
I wear my triple whites like everyday and I’ve got some choices but it reigns supreme
It last for a very short time. The sole gets worm very easily within a month. After 1 year the sole gets shredded. I would go for nike epic react Flyknit instead
"Worth it's for quailty, i walk and climb latters all day and still can go hiking in the same shoe"
Just bought my first ultra boost in this colorway and I gotta say this is the best sneaker ever
"Got my first ultraboost 2 years ago. It's just the most comfortable sneaker i ever tried. Just copped another one this week. Which is the 4.0 ""Chalk"""
My friend just got a pair of Adidas Ultraboost and he said they’re sooooo commmffffyyyy
I have that exact same color ultra boosts and there amazing and comfortable
"Love 'em so much. Some of the other might think about the hype but I REALLY wear them. They look good and they are my favorite workout shoes. And with them, I lost 35 kg. (for real). I wore them in Japan last year (I switch with 350V2 Zebra sometime.) and once in Thailand. I WALK all day, go to concert, get drunk with friends, etc. I used to have foot pain after I did everything I mentioned in the same day but, no more with UB or boost (nmd are less comfortable thou). Also, they are so light + PK so you don't need much room for them in your suitcase. ;)"
got my first ultra boost.. really nice walking with it.. super comfy
It's very very amazing for running I love it
Please make a video with turning the boost black
"I cannot, for the life of me, wear UB with insole comfortably. I got them 4.0 tts but its too tight on my foot, height wise. If no insole, it feels better but it still hurts my feet, around the opening. I don't know what it is, but pureboost for me feels way better. I tried going half size up, but i feel like its too long. shrug sigh"
I bought my first one yesterday and I'm thinking of buying a lot more
"I remember buying my triple white UB 2.0, and it was life changing. Since then, I've been convincing my friends to buy their own pair of UBs by lending my pair for them to try on their own feet 😂"
the first time i put on my Ultra Boost it was like a little peace of heven
When I heard he is a size 9.5 I was floored at how small his feet are but then I realized I'm a size 13 at 15 years old so maybe I'm a little bias lol
"Funny I just came back from looking at some shoes. Saw shoes similar to these  y two different brands. 
Strange.
Maybe someone can identify these two models. They were of the exact same materials from the laces to the foam. "
“Cop some groceries”
"Got the Ultraboost, Ren Zhen edition, I can tell you that they were the most comfortable shoes and look stylish for casual wear. Men and Ladies seem to eye on them but most importantly they are the most comfortable"
"Let me tell you, it's worth 180!!"
I hate how people buy shoes because of hype. I think the hype killed the ultraboost.... still dope pair of shoes.
I can't wait to get my first pair.
I just bought my third pair today
"You (subbed btw) and my buddy Ryan are my go to for boost info now! Have UB 2.0, uncaged, 93/17 and Arkyn...and i just started working at Foot Locker...so i’ll soon have a problem lol"
I have an adidas alphabounce an so in the first few weeks it fits little bit tight but now it's great so should I order this shoes in size 10 or up
You can’t really run in the UB Hes. It is not supportive and too squishy in the new versions. I’d be nice though for $180. It’s not really breathable either.
I just got the cloudfoams and OMG my feet love them.  Best shoes ever.  Like air
I just picked up a pair an hour ago. They're super comfortable
I got mine for 65 a half size too small. Praying they fit. 🙏🙏
"BOYS AND GIRLS, WHAT IS THE MODEL IN THIS VIDEO? I MEAN THE COLOR/DESIGN NEED QUICK ANSWER LOVE U ALL <3"
"Here’s My 3 reasons for you to buy the ULTRA BOOST 
1. They are the comfiest shoes out there
2. They look hella fire 
3. Nearly all colurways er nice"
Those are the exact same ones I have 😂
"Have the very pair! Also two other boosts. Absolutely worth the money spent. Super comfort, great running, great shoes."
"I mostly wear Nike’s but after buying one of these, I bought like 3 more later on"
Walking in the ultra boost is like walking on clouds
They’re so annoyingly overpriced. I want these so bad 😩😩
"Purchased my 1st pair 2 days ago, after I purchased the Nike Epic React Flyknit and I must say it is a tat softer, not much but slightly noticable. I would rate the Adidas a 10 of softnes and the Nike 9.5.  If you only buy the Nike Rpic React you will not miss the UltraBoost. Both shoes look great."
What’s is that color ultraboost called in the first 40 so seconds of the video?! 🤩🤩
"I might be the first one here, but I've tried UB's uncaged recently and they are not as comfortable as I think,.
My feet gets tired on them so easily, and when I walk quickly my arch screams at me.
TLDR, UB Uncaged is bad for me :'("
Someone tell me the colorway of the shoe shown in the vid plz
Does anyone know if the ultraboost is wide fitting
Getting one this week!!
1:10 what color way is this? :0
I grew up with Nike and now I’m getting into Jordan’s and buying the classics. But I will not argue with the fact it is the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned and wore.
anyone know the exact model or name of this pair in the vid>
I'm sure they're comfy but they simply don't look cool to me. If comfort was my main priority then I'd just cop some old folks orthopedic shoes. I've honestly never owned a shoe that I felt was uncomfortable other than dress shoes I guess.
Hes can you cut the netting off of the Deerupt Runners? I’m super curious on how it looks!
They say it's like walking on a pillow.
i love my ultraboost uncaged. one of the best shoes i own
Those CNY 3.0s in the background boi I need them
You should colour the boost black👍👍👍
Just bought my first pair...comin tomorrow...really hype
Oh yeah I'd like to see how it looks blacked out on the midsole as well! 🙌
"I copped the core black 4.0s

Edit: love them, just bought the ones in the video"
"just bought an ultraboost for my first time after being convinced after years of asking. I will try it tomorrow and see how it goes. I got an ugly color for cheap price. I guess the color doesn't matter, as long as it's comfy. I will update this."
I bought my first (and only) pair of ultra boots back in October. I got them because the vapormax  was sold out in my size and these were second on my list to purchase because of the fact that everyone says they are so comfortable. I’ve come to find that boost actually hurts my feet and I’m disappointed with this purchase and regret it. It’s not like an unbearable pain from the shoes but it just becomes annoying. Honestly my prestos and air max 2016s are a lot more comfortable than these. They look great though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 😂
It’s pricey and I bought one
just copped these over the weekend on sale. one of the best colour ways
There good but im still rolling with the adidad NMD'S
"I finally did it and you helped talked me into it. After 5 years of saying ""I'm not paying 180 for a pair of Adidas"" I just ordered this color way. My #1 reason is my job I'm standing on concrete and it's making my back hurt. Hopefully boost will help I'll also be jogging in them. Basically gonna be my new all day everyday shoe"
i got a pair of boosts and reacts...i personally prefer reacts...i just wanted to let the world know...thanks!
Bro these shoes are insane so confortable at first I regretted it because of the price but holy crap so confortnable
"I've been a diabetic for over 25 years and always used ASICS, Nike, New Balance and medium priced shoes. Then I got my first pair of Pureboost last October, even though I thought they're ugly. Needless to say, it was the best purchase I've made in years. Now I have 8 pairs of Boost shoes including the NMD'S and Ultraboost. I prefer the NMD'S a little more because they're more stable than UB. Either way, you can't go wrong with Boost and I'll never buy anything else."
How I feel about spending $180 on these? Like I just spend $180...
I copped my first ever ultraboost back in Dec '17
Nike boys we dont do 3 stripes
"Just to weigh in, the ultra boosts were my first shoe purchase anywhere close to this price, I love them, I have no regrets and I will buy more!"
"I’ve collected shoes for years. Been in and out of the game and a major Jordan/NIKE fan. With that said, the Ultraboost is what I find myself wearing any time I need to wear shoes lol they’re THAT comfortable. TBH wearing anything other shoe just makes me regret putting anything else on"
The shoe is amazing just got a pair
The ultra boost can go up to size 18 for those who wanted to know. I just got a size 17 today and they fit amazingly!
I love my Mocha 4.0’s !!!!
Does anybody know where I can get ultraboost 4.0 in size 16
have 5 pairs love ultra boost
I bought some Cookies n Cream Ultra Boosts in L.A. when they were on the shelf.
What style/ version is pictured at 2:37?
I’m on my feet all day at work. I currently wear Nike LunarGlides because they’re a stability shoe and I have flat feet. I’m curious if these would work for me. They look super comfortable.
I firstly had nmd's and loved them and then decided to buy the ultra boosts and they're so comfortable
"Good day Mr. Hes. Quick question since I have no idea when it comes to Adidas. In terms of comfort for people with flat feet, would you choose the Ultra Boost or Ultra Boost ST? I don't really mind the form factor since I'm in my 30s. Just really want a comfortable shoe. Thanks and bless you and your family."
What is the colorway of that Ultra boost 4.0? It’s looks amazing
Just got my ultra boost today love em already
Love your vids. I've been a fan of the UB since i tried a sample pair 6 months before the 1.0 hit shelves. Hard to not wear ultraboost every day due to the comfort. They do look pretty sleek also
HOW the HELL do you keep the boost so clean?!
🔥🔥 like a cloud
Running in the ultra boost was hard. It felt like I had to scrunch up my toes cuz of the upper. It also gets a little warm for me. I have to use a special insole with carbon fiber in the heel cuz the boost is to mushy. So I would rather recommended then casually than for running
"Def worth every single dollar, i have knee problems and i would recommend to everyone !"
Im very happy my ultraboosts came today!! It’s the core black/ true green/ gold met if anyone wonders
Was thinking of getting these customized.
"been using pureboost for the last 5 mos then i tried to buy my first ultraboost(mocha)colorway & man i definitely feel the difference its not just about the comfort but the balance it provide when i run in it maybe its the effect of that torsion system this shoe provide,definitely gonna cop my 2nd this weekend"
I feel the same with pure boost...realy comfort.
"I just bought my 5th pair of ultra boost, the ultra boost 19. Ultra boost are the best show I’ve ever worn. PERIOD"
great vid. Debating ultras vs some higher priced air maxes so this really helps!
I really want those ultra boost he used in the video and anyone know how to clean all white UB
"Boost and Para-Tek?
See:
para-tek.com
What do you say?"
"Tried them and compared them to the nike react and UA HOVR tecs and I think the UB were the worst. The primeknit makes the feet look quite wide on the outside and isn't as comfy for my foot, guess everyones different there."
"this things is perfect,i've just bought a pair of UB 4.0 Triple Black and i have no regrets LOL"
"You think ultraboost are the best comfortable sneaker, try the EQT boost !! OMG!! You gonna change your mind!!"
"I love the boost technology and the comfort it provides when I have tried them on, but I hate the way boost looks, I am still baffled that something as tacky looking as boost became so popular, it just looks like white leprosy on a mid sole to me, cage it, make it so it cant be seen, I just never liked the way it looked. And dont think I hate adidas or anything, I copped the Roundhouse Mid back in 2010 before adi blew up (dope pair of kicks btw), boost just aesthetically does not look pleasing to the eye at all to me."
"I really agree. I'm only 14 and i'm already on my 4th pair of ultra boost, I realy recomend buying a pair, if you are thinking about it."
Number 6: Eliminates the 'traditional' process called tying shoes...
"I'm still waiting for gazelle's with boost tech. Once those exist, I'll subscribe for delivery every 2 years."
I'm wearing ultra boosts right now
Does it actually feel like Cloud foam?
I had heel problems and so I needed new shoes.... i bought ultraboost and havent had problems since
Bought my pair for 125 euros. Great buy.
What's the name of this colorway? Looks great!
What colorway was the one you featured in this video?
I just bought a pair and they changed my life. Wayyyyy nore comfortable than the nmd
"Did you say “four dot 0”, yeah no."
Mine were like 3 times more than sneakers that i normally buy 210
Gottem for $108 and they were amazing
omg i stoped the video then the shoes came and get a ultra boost hahahaha
Can’t afford. So I got the nmd boost. I am in love
Could u do an ultra boost laceless review?
i'm hooked on adidas boosts.  i was an avid nike buyer for 25 years.  purchased at least 150 pairs up until recently.  the boost comfort shits all over everybody's everything in the shoe market.  my first pair was the pure boosts.  those are crazy comfortable but then i tried on ultra boosts and had that holy shit moment when they were even more comfortable.
Top 5 sneaker shop in Portland area (not including employee stores)
No disrespect but I feel you’ve done this video 3 times already
I bought my ultra boost about 5 to 6 months ago and they are still going strong they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet and I have absolutely no regret buying them so I definitely recommend them to anyone
It hurts my ears the way you say decimal numbers. 4 dot O.
Because of you I bought the 4.0 tech ink and the DNA (my profile pic with checkerboard laces) a while ago. Best purchases I made for comfort so thanks for that
I wanna try on a pair n find a navy or camo green color way
CAN WE SEE YOUR SHOE COLLECTION!
I do weightlifting and hiit does ultra boost work well with weightlifting as well or mainly just running shoes?
"I just got my first UB and while they are comfortable, they are overhyped IMO.  Everyone was raving about how its a life changer, its the most comfortable shoe ever and how its like walking on clouds.  While I dont regret my purchase because I love the style of them and the colorway (cookies and creme), dont fall for the hype."
superb shoes.. rekindled my passion for running..
Are these good for amazon warehouse?
I’m getting mine tomorrow and I’m so frickin excited!!!
The shoe is so cumtable p.s I’m talking about the 4.0
I copped the blue parley 3.0 for 120 of StockX and they are amazing by far the most comfortable shoe I’ve owned. Really want a triple white pair but don’t really want to pay that price
Is that the 4.0 in the reversed oreo colorway?
Yea I just got the eqt boost support for 52 and the other boost shoe that has that retro vibe for 67 so not gonna pay over 100 for boost
ill try it if you buy it for me :)
After buying it I never regretted it
feels good great for running not so much for a slow jogger if you know what i mean the tire tech from continental is sticky and glued to pavement im enjoying the purchase and experience
In India it's 17k we pay double 😂😂😂😂 that's about $224.  I wish it was low out here
Just copped these...definitely worth it. Nice colorway too.
Im on my 6th pair.
what style of ultra boost is he wearing?
"I bought my first pair of ultraboosts, the CBC Ultraboosts in the Black and purple with the leather heel cup. They are so comfortable and the upper is the best!"
It’s a great shoe and it’s one of if not the most comfortable shoe I’ve worn
ive had ultraboost for 6 months its great!
Ultra boosts are definitely the best shoes I have ever bought. They are very comfortable. The only con is the boost stains real quick
AMAZING SHOES just hate how triple whites always have some kind of yellow tint to them
is it wide feet friendly?
I already bought the ultra boost 3.0 in black/grey.....superrrrrrrr comfy
I’m stuck between the Oreo 4.0 and the Beige ones.Which ones shall I buy
Did he actually say “one dot oh”??
"Dont buy these and expect to be a good running shoe, they are best for a very static lifestyle, if you are active defenetly not. They are aldo fragile."
2:25 what's the name of that colorway
do ultra boost have a size 6 or 6.5 because I have small feet :(
I bought them for back to school ($130 cad ) and they are so comfortable my feet don’t hurt very often now and they look great. I have the Black/White model
I spend over a100 bucks 💸💰when ever I get new shoes
It’s a great shoe it’s stylish you can dress them up or dress them down the comfort is great. I recommend you buy a pair.
The 4.0 in this colorway was my first pair of ultra boosts. It’s safe to say that Adidas hooked me with these shoes now lol
i just got my first pair of ultraboost 4.0 and they should be here by the end of the week !
Can someone tell me what color way and version is that in the video..the sort of blue one
Just bought my first pair of Ultraboost.  I’m in my 30s so I’ve tried several different shoes although I’ve mainly been a Nike fan.  I went to the mall today specifically to buy the Nike Air Vapormax Utility.  The sales guy suggested I try the Ultraboost.  I was blown away by the comfort!  I ended up going with the Ultraboost.  They are the most complete sneakers I’ve ever owned. I can’t believe I’ve been missing out all these years.  The color way I bought is the black / teal with the black sole.  Apparently they just got released 2 weeks ago.
I have 11 pairs and still counting
which color are the ones from the thumbnail ?
I bought my ultra boost 3.0 triple white almost a year ago and they still are in great shape. I love my ultra boost and definitely do not regret buying it
Got them for 90€ yesterday!
"How do UBs compare to EQT 93/17's in terms of comfort, feel, and sizing?"
What does a size 13 look like though?
"Can someone help me out and tell me the specific ultra boost shoe and color at :30

I cant find any shoe that looks like that on the Adidas site. There's one black with white speckles but it doesn't have nearly as much white as the one in this video. "
You sound like Josh from SRFU
AMAZING SHOES
How is it for people with flat feet? My feet are so flat that my ankles will roll inwards if I don’t have good arch support
I can’t wait to cop some groceries in these shoes
"What is the name of this colourway?
And maybe if you can, can you add a link to this colourway. Thanks!"
Let’s get this man to a million
i have the same exact color way! after 1 week with these it’s hard to go back to another shoe. Found at foot action for $150. no regrets!
I bought the color way in this vid and i love them. The only downside is that the white boost gets very dirty
I bought the 4.0 and like 30 mins later the lace hole cracked but they are still wear able
Laceless ultra boost are realy good too try it out
Forgot to talk about how easy it is to put on
I bought a pair of the uncaged ultraboost yesterday but I haven't got them yet
My ultra boost is the best shoe I have it is amazing
I have these and they’re definitely worth it
For me the comfort is more in the cushioning around the shoe mare than the soul
I want to see this in black boost. :)
"I don’t recommend light kids where this as the boost will not, well boost of you to light"
I'm debating about getting them but I'm not sure bc there so expensive
Love them
How can I buy those excact same ones?
"Dang these are so dope. I always wanted to try a pair, ive only worn one pair of boost shoes, the adizero boston 6. i feel the ultraboosts are just on a whole other level. Btw great vid Hes"
Got my first two pairs. Got them at an addidas outlet store. 50% off!!!! I was blown away by the price savings.
i saw these go on sale yesterday for $115 shipped. ya'll don't have to give in to the high markup price
What colorway is in the vid
Yes ub is amazing
Can you do a video on how to clean ultra boosts
There great I have a pair
does this shoe have glue fallen out at the heelcage
Easily the most comfortable shoe
"1 dot oh, 2 dot oh, 3 dot oh, 4 dot oh"
"Saw some at champs sports on sale for 100 dollars, worth it?"
"Which is the best adidas ultraboost version ? The 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 or 4.0 ?"
Hey guys! Can you please help me out because I don't know whether I should buy ultraboost or vapormax?
"Love these shoes! Nothing compares, since my first pair I’ve bought 3 more and I just can’t stop myself!"
in canada there 260 for the uncaged and 250 for the caged
"I never paid full retail for my ultra boost I paid 120. But I still believe it's too much due to no extra laces no fancy box or nice leather. I believe full retail should be 110 USD but my experience has 
Been ok. But under armour charged runners are still better and retail for 100"
Ordered the white ultraboost 4.0 can't wait to receive it!!
"I tried ultra boost today at a store and it felt harder to me than the cloudfoam. Maybe the ultra boost would really shine of I had a chance to run around, but I couldn’t do so in the store."
"I really want to buy this shoes, but the price in my country is same as 1 month salary.. :D"
Man I like to try some ultraboost 😭 but I can't buy one... Sucks for me lol
This guy clearly lives at home w mom
Hey men what pants are those?
I jut got a pair of the ultra boost a few days ago. I’ve never paid more than $80 for a pair of shoes so I was hesitant but after trying them on in the mall I was set!! They have been the most comfortable shoe! I love them! I also have knee and back problems and these have definitely helped with the pain!
If you haven't tryed ultra boost i dont know what your doing its 2018
just bought 2 pairs on sale for 95Euro each. Green and black. Love them. Most comfortable shoe I've ever owned.
Can I know d difference btwn ultra boost uncaged and ultra boost terrain and other ultra boost shoes?
"I want these, but they are just way to expensive. Does anyone know how low you can get them? I might consider if it's very cheap."
I just copped the one that you are wearing yesterday lol
Black ops baby! Blackout Edition
"Just picked this up yesterday, underrated colourway"
Name of that colorway?
How would you compare sizing to Nike lunar epic low? I heard that adidas sizing runs larger
I love the boost 4.0
"Try the Nike Airmax 95 Ultra, with the strings on the side upper, that is pretty comfy too, like walking with pillows."
4 dot o 😂
"4 Dot 0? Boi, it's 4 point 0"
It first came out in 2015 so its actually 4 years sry
Def worth owning 1 pair of ultra boosts. Different than any other shoe I’ve ever worn
"I work at Walmart, 8 hour shifts on concrete kills me, should I get ultra boosts?"
I just dropped $90 on a pair of Pure Boost DPRs. I hope the boost lives up to it's hype!
I'd probably love my ub more but they feel alittle big.  Feel my foot shifting in the shoe when i do legpresses or squats.
Can you wear them on turf?
I want to try the Ultra Boost but it's so expensive but I probably still will get them cause I love Sneakers
i just got a pair on adidas for sale as 108 dollars and the used honey coupons and copd it for 81 dollars
I just bought theese
Never had an ultra boost... EQT support 93/17s and NMDs are all I’ve had
"If you’re concerned about price, you can pretty much always find certain colorways for under retail."
Hes do you wear both 9.5s on the regular ultraboost and the st?
"So great, need more, totally worth the money"
"He literally isn’t lying, these are the best shoes ever"
The sole looks like its made from polystyrene i guess there's no need for special packaging in transit
Bruh boost is life is about cars 😂😂😂
Who else pauses in the beginning to see what shoe u see
Best shoe for running and gym
My wife and I just bought a couple pair of Ultraboosts. We cannot wait to rock them! We have a bunch of NMDs but these will be the 1st of that model.😬😬
"Hes do you also feel like its a little too snug on the tongue?  I already went half a size up, and it still feels tight on the tongue part, the full size up is way too long though and kinda fits sloppy. Also do these break in over time?"
"Am I the only one who wants to know where to buy these ones?
Please let me know"
"I have like 7 different pairs of ultra boost and 5 pairs of NMD's and also a couple of Pureboost and also a lot of Nike shoes, i gotta say tho: Ultra Boost is amazing! Even tho they're 180+ $ they're still completely worth it. I bought 1 pair then i just kept going and look at me now? I got a lot of Ultra boost shoes🙂 and i love it❤💪"
How do you lace your shoes? I've tried but the shoe lace is too long or the shoe is loose lol
Outsole wears so bad in the midsole when u walk on concrete it gets so flat and then wears into the boost in like 2 months if you wear them a lot
Cop some groceries 😣😳😭😂
Stay away from 4.0’s. Look like clown shoes with the pin stripe on the PK
Got the ren zhe UB for almost 6 months now.... No regrets
My very first ever ultraboost is coming in the mail Thursday !
I really hope nobody actually wears these on a date night with a button up. Lollll
They are literally clouds they are so comfy
PAINT IT BLACK!!!!
Not sure if I want to spend $270 CAD (with tax) for it though
"I regret buying my ultra boosts, I like them too much to wear them"
These shoes make your feet super hot
I have worn triple white 3.0’s for a year now and am more than happy with them. I’m copping cookies and cream 4.0’s for next school year
What colourway are these?
Black out the boost :)
I returned ULTRABOOST ST after one week of usage. I think they are too hyped
It is so worth it but the design isn't that good I would say (my opinion)
I got my ultra boost for just under €100 .a steal
Just got my first pair
"I purchased my 1st pair of Ultra Boost Sept 14,18,  All I have to say is !! AWESOME !! Will buy about 3 more Colors."
I just the 19s
I want ultra boost so bad but my parents wont let me because they are expensive
Best. Sneaker. Ever.
I think the only comparable comfort is from the “iniki” or as it’s now called the I-5923 👌
Which ultra boost model is he showing throughout the video?
what colour wave is it??
Should i buy the ultra boost 1.0 core black for 125€ (sale)?
I love wearing ultra boosts. They are more comfortable than a nice pair of socks. I've slept in them.
Boost is the best thing that happened to Adidas
Can someone trek with these shoes?
"But theyre expensive!! What would be a budget or alternative ultraboos, especially for runningt? PureBOOST? Dpr?"
i personally prefer epic react
"Honestly they really aren’t worth It, i own a pair and honestly they get dirty very fast, and even if you scrub them with lists of force or wash them as many times as you want they will always be dirty, and don’t think the black boosts are the way to go the paint will just come off"
It's worth it I have 4 pairs
Cannot pay more than 100 euro for this shoes in Romania -WAY TOO EXPENSIVE
"I've tried them on and they are comfy, but comfy for running. I feel weird JUST walking in them because they feel so forwardly angled, that I always feel like I'm on my tip toes. For walking and lifestyle, 91/18's are my choice and I'm surprised its still so slept on."
Here to tell anyone who is bothered that boost is worth buying 👍
"Walking through Disney World every weekend(not fun). I see AT LEAST 27 Ultra Boost,  6 Gucci,  19 vapormaxs,  LV(forgot the #)  and etc. This is all based on the last visit. Yes me wearing my Vapormax Utility's I felt poor."
The color of the shoes that appear in this video appear to be the Core Black/Carbon/Ash Silver model which I believe was 2018. They are sold out on adidas website. Anyone know where to get a pair?
"I've had a couple pairs of the ultra boost. I liked them due to the comfort. Then I tried the Nike vapormax and I didn't look back. I prefer the feel of the huge air bubbles on feet after a week wear. I liked the vapormax more than the ultra boost after the wear in period of the vapormax with this shoe being the perfect shoe for my daily life. The boost bottoms out after a while and doesn't feel the same. However my vapormaxs from a year ago, I still wear regular with the same comfortable and responsiveness from the full-length air sole."
you should make a top 5 video of cheap ultraboost alternatives
Yes blackout the soles 😁
They are acually really good
Yeah these are the best shoes out there
Ultra boosts are hype and HELLA comfortable
1:15
"UB vs EQT Support? 

I just bought an eqt from people saying that it's more comfy than UB. Since I got for a good price, I'm now debating if I should save up for UB"
Just got the parley collabs they’re mad comfy
These shoes be lit.
What colorway is that?
200€ here in Finland is the main reason for not having a pair.
Am 95s for days
Are these 4.0s?
most worth shoes for me all time
So.... which colorway should i get?
The ultra boost is killing it!!!
what would you ask Ben Herath if you met him?
I am going to buy a pair in Black Friday.
Totally worth every single cent
Are you gonna cop the clima ?
"If i have 43 in UB Uncaged, should i get also 43 in Ultraboost 4.0? Pls answer quickly"
Love my Ultra Boost
Not lying I just got my first pair of ultra boost today the 3.0 Oreos. I have worn boost before but never ultra boost. I don't think my feedback would be great after only 5 hours of indoor use but once I stepped in it is crazy comfy
Just bought the grey one
Ultra boost mad worth it I bought 3 pairs
just got a pair for $90 at the adidas factory story
"i totally agree, bought my first pair after half year of using jordan eclipse, and i don't really- i mean at all regret giving out 170 for first pair, now it has been around 7 months or 8, and am going for second pair and third at the same time"
Great video 🙌
Hes...crispy UltraBOOST! 4.0 seems a little tight now compare to my 3.0 for a size 10. Go 1/2 size up for anybody who wants these. You can take out the soles but I prefer them inside the shoe. and the custom you did on these....damn! Super crispy!
I wanna get ultra boost 4.0 but all the stores are sold out of them and they only have 19s
I bought a pair of pure boosts a while back and I wore them like crazy. After about 6 months they began to hurt my feet. I think it has something to do with the fact that I barely have an arch in my foot but it’s made me skeptical of getting any other pair of boosts.
i love them
I got ultraboost for 260$ :(
Can you do a Ultra Bost 4.0 top 5 colourways
"I love UB but breathability honestly sucks on them for it being a Knit shoe, I find prime knit on UBS to be a bit too thick and the end like a heat trap. Wearing  boost all day I end up with some real sweaty feet, that might just be me but a lot of people I know say the same."
I cant find that color way anywhere :c
Ultra boots is insane. I've puted them on yesterday and didn't wanted to get of because it's so comfortable and well cushioned. Very soft primeknit upper boost technology and that's unreally Comfortable shoe. Wish someone that doesn't have some pair had money to cop it and fill the comfort
I have  pure boost and  eqt support boost I can’t wait to get ultra boost 👽👽
The Ultra Boosts are nice but the colorways make me want to fall asleep.
4:42
"I feel that my Nike Lunarepic Flyknit 2 lows are the most comfortable shoes ive owned. I tried on some boost at the outlet store and wasnt very impressed. But, as Hes says, all boost are not created equal, so maybe i should give the Ultra boost a wear and see if they can pull me away from my Lunarepic Flyknits."
Just bought this pair of Ultraboosts
"I honestly think they overhyped, huaraches or puma nrgy could quite honestly be more comfortable. A little bit of a let down"
"4 years ago I bought my first pair of ultra boosts. Haven’t put anything else on my feet besides dress shoes since. I was a restaurant manager for over 10 years, and my feet and legs have taken a beating. I’ve tried to find a more comfortable shoe, but to me, nothing compares to Boost. I know there is so much hype around the ultra boost, but when you get in your 30s and up, this shoe bring what you need in everyday life. I’ve spread the word of Boost to whomever will listen. I’ve even gone so far to sell my adidas shoe collection of over 100 pairs because anything else other than Boost on my feet feel like bricks. For me, Boost is truly life."
This is the first colorway of the 4.0 that I kinda like besides the all white with the classic black bottom like the og white pair that put ultraboost on the map(also thanks to ye)
The triple black 4.0 is an awesome look
what colorway is that?
What kinda pants are these?
Yea black them out I have a pair I’m going to black mine out also
What’s the sku number for that color?
Ultra boosts may be one of the ugliest pair of shoes I’ve ever seen🤮 they literally look like something a grandpa would wear
"The only bad thing about buying my first boost is I want another one, and another one, aand another one, basically all of them."
"i have the ultra boost st


is there a diffrence in comfort between the st and the normal one? "
best sneaker I've invested in you couldn't have described them better!
"I usually spend about INR 3k ($60 to 70) and copped UB 2.0s on adi Indias sale for 40% off and still had to convince myself.. After that I've also bought vengeful boost, solar boost and now I am saving for ultra boost atr"
Best shoes ever
Would it be bad to casually run in Ultra boost?
Try EQT's
Boost is a meme on this channel
in what world you can dress these up with a button up shirt?? :D no no no nooooo
What's more comfortable? New Balance 574 or these?
imo the yeezy v2 is more comforable than the ultraboost
just got a pair from adidas website for 70€
No regret! It’s the most comfy sneaker and that’s it. I got 2 pairs.
Im pretty sure  if you  can spend almost1000  dollars on unhealthy foods at your local walmart then im sure you can buy  very comfortable  180 dollar shoes that last for years
They are awesome
"I have 5 pairs of ultra boost that I still wear. So damn comfy and even after all this time, I still find myself shocked at how comfortable they are!!! Sounds crazy but it’s true, I guess they’re just that amazing :)."
"Black out the boost right away, I'm trying to decide between the 1.0 cookies and cream and the 2.0. The blacked out boost can be the deciding factor."
They are super comfortable
i love that oreo color way
there so comfy
I have all white 4.0 they were $185 honestly the best investment super comfy you won’t experience this type of comfort on any other shoe that isn’t boost
I hate the fact that i cant afford it since it almost $2000 here. Since RM4 equals to 1 dollar
Should i get eqt 93/17s or ultraboosts?
"Those shoes might be comfy but they just aren't my style. I always opt for Nike dude. 
I know you're not a runner but can you do show more Asics kicks? They're running shoes might not be stylish but the gel tech in the serious runner shoes are super freaking comfy."
Got em for 40% off. Satisfied.
should i buy ultraboost or ultraboost uncaged? please suggest me
"It’s not that I don’t want to try it, it’s that I can’t get the money to get a pair☹️"
"Just bought the all white Clima UB’s and it’s like walking on a cloud, they’re incredible"
You can get identical replicas made from the same factory and materials for $50-$70 on reddit yuppos recommended store.
Where do you buy the gray and black one?
Cop some groceries
"I ussualy buy some nike under 100 but i went to adidas store and gave it a try, my gish the confort and the style was amazing, i recomend it, but try to make it durable, it is a bit expensive"
I got mine for 80 bucks on finish line😎
Is the shoe suitable for people who have flat feet like me?
"I'm sorry but the way you said ""dot"" instead of ""point"" ruined this whole video for me xD"
Is there any ultra boost on sale?
I'm 12 and I wear the same size shoe as him why
Picked up 1.0 Triple Blacks and 2.0 Gold medals last week!
What colorway is that?
They’re worth it
"Ultraboost and Yeezy 350, best shoes there are, don't even want Nike"
Best sneaker ever.
what is the colour of the upper called Hes ?
"i love my core black 4.0s but i got a rip in the left lip which doesnt even show, but i just hate knowing i fuccd them up. definitely gonna try to keep good care of them from now on"
what kind of trouser is that? skinny? it looks so good with ultraboost
What kinda pants are those hes???
what pants are those?
"Can you do a top 5 for why I should buy the NMD?
I agree with all your points, I'm going to send this video to all my friends who are still sleeping. The UB and NMD are two of my most favorite shoes I've ever worn!"
How does the Ultra Boost fit compared to AlphaBounce?
Just bought my first UB as it was on sale for $120 AUD (rrp is $280 AUD in australia)..can't wait till they come!
Crazy how popular these have gotten.  I wanted a pair badly when they first came out 5 years ago but couldn't bring myself to drop that kind of money on an essentially cloth sneaker...they were even more expensive at the time.
Cop some groceries
250$CAN was a really high price for me compar to my last 80$ shitty shoe.. IT WORTH IT!! I love the ultraboost
Is it worth that price to buy the Ultra Boost All Terrain for that waterproof paintcoat?
What do you think about the Ultra Boosts 3 Black Multi-Color?
"I have an Ultraboost 3.0 and it does not last as long as a performance shoe (lol) and it is a high cushioning category shoe. The  positive things about the shoe :upper is amazing and it will last a very  long, the boost over time gets more comfy but loses some response . The negative and the reason I was super disappointed with Adidas os that the outsole, Continental rubber don't last two months with 5k running 3X a week of use only. For the outsole to be totally bold and starts to really hit hard the boost itself will take about 4-5 months but when it starts to happen the shoe that is one of the most unstable ( some freedom is good until certain point)shoe ever made starts to become dangerously unstable with the rubber is gone in the forefoot area and out."
"adidas Ultraboost Undefeated Schuh, 10,2 cm, Schwarz (schwarz/weiß), 39 EU 
https://amzn.to/2Ykf0MP"
Blacked out please. Planning to buy this specific pair
"Boost is a legit cushioning tech. It actually works, impact protection and rebound are there. It’s not a marketing gimmick like the Air sole when it first came out. Let’s face it, you can’t really feel the Air Max working, coz it’s probly the EVA carrier that does most of the cushioning."
got the ultraboost 4.0 core black for a week ago and i am totally satisfied with them.. i would rate em' 10/10 because honestly it's the best shoe iv'e worn
180 dolars? In my contry you find them at 221 dolars.... and we are poor compared to America. But i got mine at 110 so its all good.
cop some groceries
Yes do change it to triple black Heskick !!!
Ultra boost are nice shoe but I would go with adidas pureboost which has same comfort at lower price
"Great vid. Can you honestly say these are more comfortable than the EQT 93/17’s? Not a lot of support in the EQT, but they’re pretty darn comfortable."
To expensive $130-$180
I honestly don't feel a difference between ultra boost and gel lyte
I just copped the new black and white ones which was nice after the L I took on the cookies and cream
"In Mexico a pair can go almost in 5000 Mexican pesos, which is like 280 usd suuuuper expensive/:"
Bought these shoes for $280 cad and It’s worth it!
"I feel the ultra boost is only great up to a size 10/10.5 being a larger shoe size 12-13 I feel like the toe box doesn’t scale well and I always find the outside of my feet just slightly over the edge of the boost, I found the 91/17 and Iniki better but a bit roomy. I’d say the king boost shoe is the InikiXMatathon crossover, great arch support+superior toe box and obviously the full length boost midsole."
"I have the ultra boost 3.0.     They are the first pair I got of boost, they are comfy but they are definitely the most comfy at first.. I still like them and they are still the most comfortable shoe I’ve ever worn."
i have 2 sneakers on list. ultraboost and jordan 3 black cement.
Reason 4:  You're desperately looking for any attention you can possibly get and aren't a real runner.
what colorway is that
"No, refuse to pay for something that bottoms out so quick."
"The ultra boost fit like a very comfy and stretchy soft sock , they are so worth it I really hope that you are influenced by this video to buy yourself a pair of ultra boost"
"Should I get this if I already have the eqt 93/17?
What are the differences?"
Why do you sound exactly like soccer reviews for you???
How about the Ultra Boost X for Women? Would you say it's comparable to the original one?
Seeing a blacked out sole would be cool. Also please tell me were you get your zipper ankle pants
I'll buy them if you give me the money to get them
"Regarding your point about ""No regret"", I have a personal story that proves otherwise. For disclaimer I am a boost fan through and through. So when it is time for my girl to cop a new pair of sneakers for the gym I got her a pair of the Ultraboost X when it first came out. Looks awesome. Very comfortable. The problem is the sock collar gave my girl blisters on her ankles something fierce. I noticed the hot spot is right where the stitching are on the collar. She can still use them with ankle socks though, but aesthetically it is not as nice. After a while I brought her the Epic React and she is loving it. I also noticed that on current iteration of Ultraboost X there's actually a strip of material covering the stitching on the ankle collar, so obviously it is not an infrequent complaint."
how about nmd? they are just as comfortable
I told myself I would never pay anything over $100 for shoes. Then I was convinced by friends to try some ultraboosts. Luckily got a huge discount through Adidas and only paid $105 total. Well let's just say I'm now buying a 2nd pair. Walked about 8 miles while on a trip in san Francisco and felt like I was walking on a cloud all day
"was always against, buying shoes over 100. still am, but these were on sale for 120ish so i bought them. great purchase. would buy again only on sale"
He's Put tape on top half and paint the bottom half black 1st. See how it comes out before you paint the whole midsole
"I stole my first pair off a locker at the community basketball court. Damn stinky, but they’re super comfortable."
Have you tried the vans ultrarange
I tried Ultraboost and the thing inside the tongue was digging into the top of my foot by the end of the day and it was very painful. I was going to try a half size up but I can still feel that thing when I was trying it on putting it on my foot.
I have the red pair
I have about 12 pair of boost. The iniki boost is super comfortable...but ..ultraboost is life. It's like walking on clouds.. that's I'm adidas sneaker loyalist.
"Can you do a review on the laceless ultra boosts? I bought the ones with black boost, a dark gray thing that replaced the laces (I don’t know the real term for it), black heel cups, and grey prime knit. I have been told that they look dumb, but also that they look slick. My sister told me that she thought I was wearing black slides with grey socks, and I don’t know if I want to look like that. They feel pretty ok, but I don’t know if they look good. I just want to see what you have to say about them."
Which one is better for walking Adidas ultra boost or ultra boost parley?
they are awesome
"Sorry but I won't ""try"" 180 dollars"
I'd say the ATRs fix the durability issues
Worth the price
Hes is the type of guy who says dot instead of point
they are 70 dollers\
"From a looks point I totally dig them. I recently purchased the 4.0 triple white. From a comfort standpoint, I found the pure boost 2017 to be a bit more comfortable for daily wear (maybe because they’re a bit wider?). I do think the ultra boost are more squishy and breathable tho."
My ultra boosts are delivering to me😡
Too much $$ for a pair... I go to China for copy... or take them off a dead guy at his funeral...
"I have the NMDs and the UltraBoosts are way more comfier. The NMDs although are comfortable, the Ultraboost provide more support and stable for the foot inside while the NMD's have too much primeknit which makes them feel light and breathable, but not comfortable enough"
You should black out the boost but somehow make the “ultraboost” word on the heel cup white
I always see this compared to other shoes but what about other running shoes? running shoes have always been comfortable
The ultra boosts are so lit
It’s not environmentally friendly so no
I'm one of those people that didn't spend more than $100 but the shoes hooked me and they did not disappoint
"if only the mid-soles didn't
 turn yellow...."
Nice one Hes. Please do black out the boost.
😂 cop some
"What do you think about the eqt, is the same?, Better?"
adidas boost line has not really picked up here in the philippines...but i'm actually contemplating about buying a pair of boost shoes.
i bought the ultraboost triple white 3.0 and bruh i loved that but then i traded them away for oreo jordan 4s and now i kinda wish i didnt because the ultra boost was so comfortable and good looking(in my opinion) compared to the oreo 4s
Best commuter shoes
tie your shoes
I love it but I don’t think it’s worth $180
"What color is featured in the outside shots of you rocking the sneakers?? Is that NYC bodega, cause it isn’t parley ocean blue like I have"
i have a one they look good for sure but comfortable i dont think so they are just normal
I have them
I love sneakers 😘
"I need some help with the sizing. I have really wide feet so I had to get a 12.5 on my Eqt 93/17 they are way to big in the toe area, but I need the space on the size. On most nikes I have a 12. does someone got expirience with ub on wide feet"
"I had an Ultraboost and after 6 months both of the shoes ripped from the outsole, send it to Adidas and they replied me as ""user fault"" even in the boundaries of warranty and I am not a runner, I sent a complaint mail and they send it to Adidas Turkey and they replied same. I decided to never buy Adidas again and bought Nike Air Zoom Vomero 13. Long story short, Adidas was a $180 of regrets for me."
180 dollars is too much for running shoes.  Real runners knows shoes wear off in 6 months.
What's there serial number. Tanks
isnt ultrboost running performance pretty low? its more of a casual runner shoe than a performance runner. since it doesnt offer support with the very flexible and thin knit upper and the thin rubber sole wears out too quickly therefore losing alot of traction.
doas yeezy count
"Yeah I copped my first pair of ULTRAboosts 4.0 all white with the black Continental rubber in February, I haven’t worn them yet. A $180 is the main reason why I haven’t worn them yet. I gifted a pair of pureboosts and those feel comfortable. It’s funny you said Las Vegas because I purchased them for my trip to Vegas."
Black out the boost!!!
Only wear Nike and Jordan's. I bought 1 pair of Adidas and never again. Plus they look like elf shoes they are only missing bells on them.
"Ugly casual looking shoes found at Famous Footwear, etc."
What colorway are these
Now i have 3 ultraboost
How do you think 3.0's fit vs 4.0's. I got a pair of 4.0 core black in 10.5 but want to grab some 3.0 grey three's but only have a size 10. Should I be ok?
I bought a pair of EQT 93/17 idk how they compare to the ultra boost but I didn't find them comfy at all. I recently purchased under armour hovr phantoms and shoes are amazing
"Dope , sikk video"
"I'd like to see the wear timeline between Ultraboost Continental rubber vs NMD traction pad.  Low key kinda disappointed how fast my NMD's are wearing through, already half way to the boost.  Wish it had Continental rubber but maybe twice as thick for longevity."
"If you are concerned about the ultra boost price which should be commonly found as $180, wait until a price drop or holiday sales to purchase one. I got mine for $75. Honestly, the ultra boost is worth $180, however if you want to save money, wait till Christmas, Black Friday, etc. Leave a like if this was helpful."
Shoes lose their cushioning even they dont use them. Just buy the new model.
"if theres an ovo ultra boost MAYBE then i'll pay $180 but other than that i dont plan on buying a pair. they arent my style. ""nike boys we dont do 3 stripes"""
Nah it's not responsive at all and not breathable either
For someone who is really really wanting to get drunk
What coulerway is this
Can you use this in the rain I am a dumb person
Everyone is talking about how comfy the ultraboosts but its kinda dissapointed when i tried it
"Are they good during fall too ? If not, what sneakers are ?"
Overpriced
I prefer the pure boost anyday so comfortable
Ahhhh uugly
"I got mine at $96, let’s hope they’re not fake 😅"
Ub one thing to say “worth it”
"If UB was way cheaper, i am sure people won't be so hype about them. Personally, people has told me so much how the UB was so comfortable etc..I finally bought one and i was not blown away."
Buying this purchase
Should I get the caged or uncaged? Does it really make a difference?
What is the best colorway for a Ultra boost?  I'm planning on buying one to wear casually to school and to the gym or walk around.   I don't wear anything consider to be hypebeast clothing.  I tend to dress more preppy but not to crazy.
Would you say this colorway goes better with everything or the all black??
best shoe ever so comfortible
too expensive for me. ill just buy the fakes with real boost
Four Dah Doe
"I got these for track and they’re so comfortable.  They’re so comfortable that I wear them for EVERYTHING and after a year and half of horrible treatment, the soles finally split. Definitely buying a new pair"
Do the blackout please
Which corner store should I rob tonight
"I love my ultra boosts!  With that being said I would not spend $180 on it unless it was a limited release or something I HAD to have.  PERFECT SHOE for jobs where you are on your feet a lot and DEFINITELY worth the money!  I just struggle to spend the $180 on a shoe I know i will beat the shit out of.  That is probably the sneaker head/mental illness coming out in me. lol.  Adidas is cannibalizing their own ultra boost hype by over-saturating the market.  Even their new releases are selling for under retail on some sites.  If it is a normal color way please look on Stock X, GOAT, or 3rd party sites first just be patient.  They are EASILY the most comfortable shoes on the market but don't spend unnecessary money because of the hype."
"I mean, you can wear them on a date night with button up and jeans, but you're better off wearing white low top sneakers or chukka boots. 

If you're dressing up these shoes, you'll end up dressing down the rest of the outfit for a worse look."
"I actually prefer the epic react by a small margin, maybe because the more narrow/snug fit is better for my foot, but still, the ultra boost is fantastic, absolutely worth every penny. I’ll buy another pair after this one is worn out."
"I have got the 3 rd pair within a year and it’s like walking in marshmallows, watch the rain and mud, can’t get it out from the sole ridges, it sort of sinks into the pattern, I have spray painted one of them silver, people liked my hack, perfect for dry day, and indoors, washing machine safe for @uick was 30 degrees 15-30 minutes, this shoes is still 10/10 of my scores"
"Hey, how durable is the Primeknit material? Like, they seem to be easily scratched and torn, ive never had these kind of shoes lol. Have only used vans my whole life"
Lol 300 Canadian.
So whats the differens between 1.0-4.0
paint it black plsss
i got nmds
I just got the triple white but I dunno they look like dad shoes to me.
is it durible though
I like the feel of the eqt 93-17's better in terms of pure comfort .  Maybe ultra boost I need to go up in size as the toe area felt really cramped compared to eqts.  I know this would obviously be better for running than my eqt.  So doing more reserarch.
Are the ultra boosts still available in that color?
It's worth the money
Ultraboost OR Ultraboost ST is number one for you?!
hes pronoucing it wrong
Black out the boost bro
So comfortable
"Bought a pair for my girlfriend and myself. Got lucky and got the grey uncaged ultra boost for only $86. I don't know why they were so cheap, but got them at foot action. Best shoe I have ever worn and I don't want to go back to any other cushion."
All blk boost..triple black bro.
should i get a white pair for school? i’m gonna be in sports but i clean my shoes & i’ll obviously have other shoes.
2 drawbacks for me. The price and boost isn't all that comfortable for me
Just got them in the mail today in that exact same black and white colorway. It is by far one of the best purchases I have ever made when it comes to clothing. I absolutely recommend this shoe to anyone.
these shoes are ooooooooooh
"The ones you see in stores are ugly, that's why i haven't tried them"
"You convinced me. I just bought a pair 4.0 retail for 130$ I went TTS but a teeny tiny bit bigger (size 44.5 EU but I went for the 44 2/3). I never tried boost before, nor seriously comfortable sneakers, or shoes in general, before. So I do hope that when my order arrives it will be as comfortable as everyone says, I will be using them all summer and I will walk a lot every single day, so if they indeed feel like walking on clouds, I will be happy :)"
I buy one and don’t use until now becoz I’m scrd off make dirty so now only watch it on tob canaba
"I think they look like Santa's lil helper shoes. Why are they pointing in the air thats ugly,  My New balance dont do that and they have suede and leather and looks better quality and are my most comfortable shoes I own."
Worth it. Buy them. Fax.
"Once you try a Pair of Ultraboost,,, there is No Other shoe that compares!!!! Period"
Yes Black boost!  Black boost everything!  Adidas need to stop being lazy and pump out way more black boost options.
"My first ultraboost is the ST, got them on sale on adidas outlet for around $120. Love the silhouette and the comfy. Lately I buy the triple black coz I don’t like the white of the boost. Then i feel the difference, the ST has more thick boost than the regular one, it more bouncy and comfy in my opinion. And for my wide foot, the ST has better fit to me."
"You should really never go ""true to size"" if you're a serious runner and putting miles on the shoe. I would say these are good true to size for street-casual wear, but go a half-size up for running. You need that extra toe room and space for when your foot swells. I am a 9.5 as well and if I buy running shoes true to size I usually have shin splints and foot pain. Bigger is better for running."
I live for boost is live. But not the shoes
NMD>Ultra
please black out the boost!!!!!!
"I just bought ultraboosts (black shoes with white stripe cages) like 2 hours ago and Im amazed how comfortable these feels when Im weating these🙏 I had to buy these after I tested my friend's ultras (the original colors) but only one minus thing in these is the prize, it's bit too much but it these really are worth of every dollar or whatever currency u have👌👌"
"Like its good and all, but im a tad overweight and have wide feet. I was recommended UB by so many. But just after have worn it 2-4hrs everyday (50-65 days total, not sure) my cage broke. Badly, no way to fix it. Rly pisses me of as i only wore it walking to and from school.  With that pricepoint their plastic should be of higher quality"
It’s not a running shoe in my opinion but they are nice I rock them with a adidas joggers
"Nice commercial but $180 for a pair of sneakers is a lot. You could buy a pair of sneakers at half way the price, add $20 pair of Dr. Scholls and I guarantee you'll have a pair comparable to ultraboost. Sneaker heads act like they never heard of custom insoles before."
c o p  s o m e  g r o c e r i e s
I don't know why but i don't like the look of the ultraboost
i had no regret
"I wouldn't say the ultraboost is worth 180 but if you can find them for a steal, go for it! I've had my pair for a year and while the boost doesn't really last if u wear them on a day to day basis they're really comfortable!"
Best shoe
I have a pair of the trippel black havens and they are way nicer than theese but not good looking doe. But the comfort is better then the nmd with an insole or a yeezy a must buy
"contemplated for a long time whether i should buy an ultraboost because i didnt want to be a hypebeast, but i heard so many good things about the boost sole and finally got myself a 4.0 last month. it lived up to expectations and im even thinking of getting my next pair soon. i'll admit they arent the most stylish looking pair of shoes but they are very comfortable for everyday wear and for light sports. also i live in singapore so it costs like $300 here. extremely steep price to pay for shoes but they're worth it."
"I just bought the winter nmd xr1, and pegasus 35 for 245 cad, but then afterwards i found the ultraboost red for 200cad, i havent recieved the shoes yet and ive never tried boost before.  Should i return the shoes and buy the ultraboost? I dont want to regret.  I need a shoe for casual(the winter xr1) and a shoe for running and the gym/training(the pegasus 35) , but im pretty sure ultraboost can do both of those. I dont want to regret what i buy. Should i switch? I live in ontario and winter is coming"
I am sexually attracted to these shoes.
Blackout the boost
Black out the boost #boostislife
Just can't bring myself to pay $200 for a pair of adidas.
I got a pair of core black ultra-boost on Mercari but it kinda stiff. I'm pretty sure its authentic because I checked and compared it with my other sneakerhead friends but the shoes are tight as hell because I regularly wear 10.5 but I went 11 and they're still tight. I don't if I just got a bad pair or I need a break in period? It looks authentic and the quality is good but the on foot feeling is completely different.
couldnt agree more. worth every penny.
I chose the vapormax flyknit 2.0 all whites over the ultraboost but I really want to cop a pair of ultraboosts
black out that boost!
"Got on sale for $153 but blue colour, I prefer black.  Hard to find ultra boost in my area. Also, have to buy bigger size or foot won't fit in.  Also got ultra boost st."
"Good to see you still advocating for UB Hes. People in the sneaker game are so fickle, it seems mostly everyone hopped back in the Nike train. There are UBs sitting that would've sold out instantly just a year ago. There is very little brand loyalty in this so called sneaker culture anymore."
Ultra boost equals god
Dot O
Ultra boosts are around 310$ here in India... too much to pay for a great pair of shoes.
"Yesterday I purchased my first ultraboost. White and royal blue 4.0 and royal blue and neon green ST. Ultraboost is very expensive in India but I got a good deal on them and I don't regret purchasing as they are extremely comfortable. Wanted to buy the multicolor 3.0 but they go for $300 in India, Might buy them if I get a good deal on them too."
Black out!!!
"People who want to buy and have their criticism:

BUY! you won't feel his full power just trying it in a local store, it's because in the first week is not well softened, after my first week walking on them, I understood why so much hype on them, it really worth it and that's not expensive, because I'm wearing it since a year now and god, it's just get better everyday, Adidas fucked well Nike ;)"
Def worth every penny #boostislife if you can get them below retail DO NOT hesitate
Can we stop now with the boost is life slogan plz. It’s not cool copying what Adidas promoted lol boost is cool but slow cooker is life. Fact. 🤣🤣🤣
180 is a shit ton to the average person
BLACK IT OUTTTTTT 😁😁😁😁
Muy buenos yo los tengo.vale la pena pagar por ellos.
No regrets.
Funny u mention Disney world because I brought nmds not ultra boost
They’re good sneakers but not as good as people hype them to be
Black them out
whats the most comfortable variation of the ultraboost in your opinion
I bought a pair in NY and loved them they are better than yeezys but don’t wear them in NY they will get scuffed
dot oh
Black it out fam !!!
👍
Black out the booooooosssttt 😎😎
BOOST IS LIFE
I think the Nike Pegasus 35 turbo
"I'll be honest Hes, I don't really understand what's the hype all about...
I bought a year ago an NMD and it actually hurt my feet, couple months after that I bought an ultraboost ST which you said to be better than the normal UB and I really can't feel anything special... I feel like Nike's lunar is more responsive and even the 30+ year old Nike Air. But maybe I have wired feet."
I don't like the ultraboost it looks weird but I'll buy one pair
1dotto 2dotto 3dotto 4dotto
There so ugly!! Might as well get some white new balance!
black boost would look sick
"For me Nike is everything not until my first Ultra Boost Yeezy just this February 2019, blown away and shocked about the comfort that’s why i bought the Ultra Boost 4.0 Orca last June and now July I got my Yeezy Antlia. When it comes to shoes Ultra Boost is everything. Now I love Adidas so much."
Black out the boost
Black out the boost
Black out the boost
"Am I the only one that dislike the way the Ultraboost looks? Tacky aesthetics, to each their own. Don’t like any sneakers with a one piece upper. Does not work well with jeans either. Personally, Asics are great on comfort and stylized much better than Ultraboost."
I realy hate adidas. I think ultra boost isn't that but but I want Material Designer in Adidas to die. Look at Adidas Boost you wear or Adidas Prophere. This shoes look like garbage!
"honestly, fakes feel the same so whats the point"
Who else likes the parley ultraboost
"Reasons not to buy:
1 - Lifes to short to buy ugly shoes.  
2 - Again... Ultra boost are mostly fugly from most angles, it's hard to find a someone to wear with them. "
Are these worth geting for 100 dollars?i need them for everyday stuff going to school and stuff like that
Black out
Who is watching this and has them ?
POINT 0
thrill me
"the UltraBoost is a great shoe.
however, i prefer the PureBoost."
"I think you should tell people that your link is an affiliate, otherwise it is a form of stealing because they don't know where their money is going when making a purchase."
I love the ultraboost but it sucks that boost gets dirty so fast and you can't really clean it
"Sorry hes, I’d disagree. I bought 3 Ultraboosts, and regretted buying 3 times. Bought 3 different occasions, thought the ones before were duds, but all 3 were duds. The forefoot cushioning felt like Nike Frees with only a bit of cushion. The heel cushion felt like firmer Lunarepics."
"Here to look for the Nike boy comments and how they say the shoe is trash, not comfy, presto is better, react is 1000% better, etc."
Ultra boost is the best shoe
so comfy
Hybebeast
Black out boost
Is it better than the 720s tho
Black that boost
"Waz up Hes?! You need to tell people go buy this shoes damn it, stop being so nice lol 😂! J/k I have 3 pairs 2 3s & one 4.0 it’s a nice shoe but like you I’m more of a lifestyle wearing shoe person! So this running/ walking shoe don’t go with everything, I have to buy basketball shoes with BOOST to match different outfits! That’s what Adidas needs to work on true lifestyle shoes with BOOST and I’m not buying yeezy shoes wouldn’t be caught dead in those shoes LMAO!"
it's simple
They don't exist in my area like fr
HIT THE NAIL ON THIS HEAD WITH THIS ONE.. ONLY THING I DONT RREALLY AGREE WITH IS YOUR GRADE ON DURABILITY.. I WOULD ALMOST SAY 2.5-3 OUT OF 5.... THE CONTINENTAL OUTSOLE WEARS DOWN TO THE BOOST IF YOU ACTUALLY PUT SOME MILES ON THEM AND THE PK UPPER WILL RIP AND GET HOLES IN THEM IF YOUR NOT PAYING ATTENTION. I HAD A PAIR THAT SNAGED ON THE CORNER OF MY BED AND HAS A NOTICABLE SNAG IN THE MATERIAL NOW..
3:40 WTF is that thing in the background
"I Just Saved Some Money I Usually Intended To Spend It On A PC Case And Some RGB Fans But When I Got Interested On Sneakers Because Of You, So I'm Going to Buy The Ultraboost Instead. Btw Do I Need To Make The Size Bigger Because Im Still Young 13 To Be Exact, My Size As Of Now Is 9 Maybe 9.5 In 2-3 Months, Do I Need To Go For A Size 10 Or 11? Can Someone Help Me With This? Thanks In Advance."

I have five pairs of nmds just cause I thought boost would feel the same and I liked the silhouette better than the ultra boost but I recently decided to get myself a pair of ultra boost but I couldn’t get a regular ultra boost in my size but I still got a pair of uncaged ultra boost and I can’t deny it was a completely different experience than any other boost shoe i totally get everything you said in the vid thanks for convincing me 👌 (first vid I came across by you btw subbed immediately)
😢😢😢😢😢
Im a nike fan i have been  forever but cmon nike fans we have to accept the truth adidas is kicking our asses in the shoe game nike keeps bringing out the same crap air normal soles uncomfortable sneakers  we just buy them to show  off a lot but ultraboosts im sorry nike but you are done
BLACK THE BOOST!!!
So dop
I have been loving boost for quite some time. However I have a major issues with ultra bosst. Trust me it’s not the style they are amazing looking. They simply are not not big guy friendly. Being a bigger guy naturally my feet are wide and my instep is bigger making it impossible to get my foot in the shoe. The sock shoe just doesn’t work for me. And I hate that it doesn’t work. So for that I rock the nmd r2 model because it has the detached tongue. I’m dreaming of an ultraboost with a detached tongue. Please Adidas make this happen.
black it out
Your videos are amazing
Those Ultra Boosts are ugly though.
Black
Nice
I wouldn't pay $59.99 for this shoe let alone $180.
Ultra boost the only problem is the outsole not durable...
Am I the only one who thinks it’s stupid that people pay over retail for ultra boosts? I never pay retail for UB. I got my uncaged petrol blue for $90 at an adidas outlet
"I generally dislike the look of the ultraboosts, which has put me off to getting one or even thinking about it at all. However, the Haven collab is actually growing on me .... hmmm... should I get my first pair?"
"And everyone, Boost was the best thing to ever happen for your feet. The first time i wore the OG Energy Boost , it was life changing. I ran in them , i work in them and now i have a collection of them. Energy, Pure, Adios, Ultra, Nmd, Eqt. If even Nike heads are giving Boost the huge tumbs up... You will miss out huge if you never own a pair of Boost. Which is the best for me, got to be Ultra Boost. Eqt 93-17 is close second. Sorry into performance than hype. So no Yeezy or Human race. Because with Ultra Boost, you can do everything. Run, work and party. You can even swim in them. And its readily available for all. How can you beat that?"
Pls paint it black....
First
BS. Ultra boost hype is dead. Btw people like you should stop saying that this are the most comfortable shoes ever made. You know that wearing UB all day long will cause you fatigue and muscle pain in your feet and calves because of  their poor support. And dont even think go out for a long run on a pair of these...that was the biggest mistake i have done in my life.
Did he just say 4 dot o instead of 4 point o😂😂
Reebok better than Adidas
Jk
"""COLORWAY""--- ROFL. This world....."
"Have multiple pars of ultra boosts, eqt support 93/17s and I have decided that I prefer vapormax to boost after a year of wearing them the cushion stays the same, boost as far as ive felt starts to lose its fluffy feeling after a while. Still comfortable just not the same as when they are new. PS nmds are Crap"
ultraboosts are UGLY!
200.00 socks are for who?...yea I bet they are on sale and as winter comes to the east and Midwest look for them to be on sale a lot.....good job aditous when TRYiNG to compete with nike make your shit like twice as much ...same fOR you NB.
"They are very comfortable, but unattractive. I would only buy the white colorway."
I think Nike Pegasus 35 turbo is better than Adidas ultra boost
learn how to pronounce ADIDAS
In my opinion prestos are comfier
"People always told me that Ultraboost were ""more comfortable"" than yeezys, however if you try on the Yeezy V'2s they are insanely comfy and sturdy, MUCH more comfortable than any Ultraboost. I also prefer the comfort and fit of Yeezy v1's (pirate black etc) to ultraboost, but that might be opinon since I have those. I also think Ultraboost are some pretty ugly ass shoes, so basically im saying why woudlnt you spend like 100$ more and get yeezys so you dont have to look like a total nerd."
I think the Nike flyknit lunarlon are quite a bit better honestly
Skechers are just as comfortable and 1/4 of the price.
Boost suck 👎🏽👎🏽 id rather run in some clearance sale under armours
"Adidas is dead, nike all the way"
