This is how you review shoes people. One of the best shoe reviews.
"Got the 19s on sale, its nice to know that there's not much difference in the tech with 20s lol. Hey can you do a review of the adidas zoneboost. Thanks."
"The Ultraboost 20 is such a clean shoe, not a runner myself, but great that they’re so functional, casual wise they’re a perfect go to with everything that’s super comfortable too. Nothing different as you say, but not a bad thing in this case"
The 19s are still expensive af lol. But I really enjoy the 19 model.
"I think it's dope we're getting running shoe reviews as well. Thank you, Mrs. Wing!"
"I got 2 Cop A Pair of Those, My oldest Son love Ultra Boost, and I see why, his brother and 2 sisters say he is a lame because he only wear Ultra Boost Adidas, I will Join my Son and Cop A Pair"
UB 20s are more restrictive and durable than the 19s imo
"Today we have a breakdown of the latest in the Boost line from adidas, the UltraBoost 20. What do you think of them? Too much of the same ol' thing, or are they tweaked just enough for ya? Let us know, and as always, thanks for watching!"
Hands down mrs. Wing.. 60 miles.. damn!! 🔥❤💪🏻
My Hefe insole came in today! Slapped the thin one in my vans and they're solid. Also size 13 so no cutting the insole 😂
You guys are THE BEST!!!  I just found a pair of 19's for half price.  Thank you SO much.  Gonna go grab them in the morning
Love these shoes! Definitely head to head with my Nike Reacts. Great stability and comfort.
"I like the mush when walking aka ub 1-4 and react shoes except for the element ones, and stability like the elements, epic reacts and ub19-20."
Ultraboosts are my favorite running shoes hands down!
"Watching this with them on , great vid guys"
Thank you guys for making such in depth reviews! Especially love that you actually run in a lot of the shoes :)
IMO there's a huge difference between the 19s and the 20s = the heel cup on the 20s is way more comfortable
"i run in a zoom fly, which i love, and my wife always asks ""when are you going to get a real running shoe?"" lol kills me every time."
This was so helpful thank you 👏🏽 great explanation which painted a specific and clear picture to someone who has never even held the shoe.
