"why y'all hating on these they straight FLAMES

also I just got this pair for Christmas and I love em"
I can't believe the decade is over
That colored boost midsole gonna make me cheat on Nike... Oooooh Adidas bout to be mistress!!
"us: what can they do to boost for better comfort
adidas: colors the boost in craziest color they can make."
IMAGINE A FIRE COLOR THAT FADES FROM RED to orange to yellow
Just bought my mom a pair of ultra boost 20s for Mother’s Day hopefully she likes em
Now that's a shoe
Finally a symmetrical cage again! Overall the 20 looks sooo much better than the 19 flop. Must cop for me!
I'm a nurse and I use these as my work shoe.  They're the 1st pair of shoes I've worked in that I haven't had to put thicker insoles in.  Highly recommend.
"Seth: Your late
Me: Sorry mr. fowler, it's not my fault.
Seth: What's your excuse this time. 
Me: The notification..... it didn't come quick enough, sir."
This shoe is what the 2019 pair should’ve  been
Hi Seth - Did you get the ultraboost leather shoes?
Honestly one of my favorite color ways this looks crazy
"seth: they aren’t released.
laughs in chinese once again"
Day 16 until Seth does a Birkenstock review
These are so sick! Huge astronomy fan and these will be in the collection! I might go for the grey cw first though🤘
"Almost the same, I don’t care much for the 20 as long as I can’t get the 19’s at reduced prices win win!"
"Damn ! The midsole color is so 🔥
Gives off a futuristic vibe"
It's like the Solarboost 19 and Ultraboost 19 had a baby
This feels like a middle ground between the 19 and the older ones I'm def copping
What a great detailed review!! I can’t wait to get my hands on a pair! I never buy a shoe without watching you Seth because I know you always give straight facts and always give your HONEST option. Keep up the great work!!
"Okay, I might have to secretly get these and hide them from my Nike collection!"
I went to finish line and told them I saw them in another store and they let me buy theme for 180
"Oh come on, I got 19's yesterday!"
Idk I kinda like them but haven’t decided yet
I remember seeing these like 3 months ago I'm glad they're finally coming out
"Adidas should keep playing with the iridescent paint on boost, love it!"
"Just bought the 19s for the first time. Now I know why they were 40% off, they were trying to get rid of them to make room for 20's."
"it's the perfect shoes, except if you live in a  rainy and gloomy country like northern europe"
Just got these now and I am thrilled to put em on ✌😃
Adidas Boost pillow and mattress are going to be the next thing 😂😂😂
The new re design looks way better and I like the nods that Adidas made to the og
"I like playing with my boost shoes in class, pushing the boost with my finger."
I like the fact that the price didn't increase so much even after the collab.
"Just finished watching the Balenciaga speed trainer review, and a notification popped up. Wow"
Love how they’re trying to go for more performance driven but no serious runner wears these 😂
"I thought the UB 19 were fine aesthetically and they were really comfortable, for daily use and running. Excited to try out the UB 20s."
Got damn these might be the best Ultraboost I've ever seen
I'm stuck at 3.0s 😂. Planning to get the 19 but let's see.
When I was shopping for shoes for me it was either the Puma X Sonic shoe or this shoe that you are reviewing but I now wish o got the sonic ones
I’ve got this specific colorway on my wish list. I just love the coloring of the Boost. Even if it’ll scuff off.
Adidas ultraboost and yeezy series are amazing are so comfortable and gives stiff competition to nike
Idk if anyone else ever had a pair but these remind me of the solar boost. The cage and shape.
Ultraboost 19 is one of my favorite shoes bc of how comfortable it is. But I don’t see too much of a crazy change for me to purchase the new one. But it’s a dope shoe for sure.
"Have just received a pair of these - really good! - love the UB 20 - fit, comfort, style all excellent - 5 stars from me ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Dat galaxy thoo 🔥🔥

Love the content keep it up!
Love from london 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿"
"i really like my 19s. kinda wish they would of made a ""uncaged"" version of the 19. i love my uncaged ultraboost the most."
these are actually really cool and i can see myself picking a pair up
They really did an excellent job with the iridescent boost 🔥
Well im convinced im still gonna go ahead and buy the ultraboost 19 😂
"Damn, every time I see the AKOG Ultraboost I get super jealous. It's such a damn good looking shoe.

Just got my first pair of Ultraboost 19s (Pride colourway, looks so good) and they are so damn comfortable. But my go to for all out comfort is still the Uncaged. Kinda sad it seems like they aren't making any more new ones and it's getting much harder to find a new pair in my size. "
I love his reviews! Hands down best sneaker channel on YouTube!
That Shiny purple-blue sole make it look unique.
I really wish I had this shoes. They are 🔥 🔥🔥💯
So glad they made a colorway that matches the Skyline. Love them!
"I love Adidas shoes, so comfortable and look dope af imo"
I just got my pair today and they are so comfortable. I usually wear a 11.5 but got a 12 and they fit perfect. Great video Seth. I never buy shoes until I watch your video first.
"If they dropped the weight of the 19s, I wouldn't mind running in them. They have a slight bounce but I would say react is more soft and comfy than the boost."
"Thought about getting these as my first pair of UB, but then I saw those All Terrain Neighborhood Ultraboost. Broke the bank, but they are amazing."
"No joke, I was strictly Nike before but this shoe changed me. Big ups Adidas"
These can't be lifestyle shoes anymore. Only performance shoes.
"I’m getting my UB20 in the morning, never had a pair but I have been waiting a week to get them in the mail, can not wait to try them out my pick up two more pairs if I like them just to have them for years to come"
"Straight flame, keep up the good work Seth ❤️"
I felt in love with this sexy boost colour OMG
Damn ! This is so dope! Hope i can get this one in black to add in my collection. 🙏🏻
when you streaming again man? It's been too long
Uff they're so cool 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i just got this for my bday and i love them
These are fire gonna sell my black static’s for these
"Dammit, 
First the Bred 11 shockdrop and now this
I guess no 4k tv this year."
"I love your content bro. Although, it would be nicer if you put pictures on the screen when talking about other shoes that are not in the video. For example the orange grey shoe @7:30"
"Just to report, I'm delighted with UB20, I'm currently recovering from LCL sprain, and had a really bad problem with walking, so my DoC advised me to something more cushioning, and then I run to your video, today was the first day after whole week that I could walk without eyes dropping pain...."
"I buy this shoe Today After the Video, so nice❤️"
Iv been wearing my 19s for about have a year and they are really comfortable and I whould get the 20s
Ultraboost 4.0 still my fav; the knit pattern on it is the cleanest imo combined with the classic silhouette
Nice Review Seth! Best sneaker youtuber ever 💯
"I just bought this shoes and my outsole rubber coming off 
Is that a bad thing?? I never wore it"
Oh my god..ITS AMAZING.
"looks like a beetle but it looks AMAZING, just look at that neochrome boost!"
"I just bought these exact ones. I knew nothing about shoes, but was looking for some running shoes. The sales person really recommended these,  very happy with the level of comfort and they way they look."
These are fire🔥🔥 definately gonna cop them! 😎
I'm still an ultra boost fan. Only bought one pair the 19. Didn't like colorways.
What are recommended outfits that would match these or the new Yeezy 350 tailgates?
It has styling cues from the solar boost 19 (toe box & heel tab)
So upset that they don’t come in my size. Never carry size 15
Just bought my first Jordan 1 in the Bloodline colorway! Can't wait
The Ultra boost 19 was my first intro to the BOOST technology and I thought I was walking in clouds. This Ultraboost 2020 is a must cop.....as soon as it goes on sale. I’m not paying 180.00 for 💩!!! 😂😂 The silhouette is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
:/ I'll just wait for them to drop price
Now please add the old Ultraboost 4.0 cage and it would be a great shoe🔥
I actually LOVE these 😍
I wish I could afford them but my country is on a economic crisis... please pray for us 🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
Damn the 20's look hella nice
Omg! I got right away 2 minutes after it dropped and I have waited a week to only know the transaction was’nt made
i have watched this video 4 times just becuase its so good looking
Gona cop a pair when the cone out with more colorways. Maybe some Grey's or browns
just bought a pair of these for work where i stand for 10 hourshope they serve me well
19s getting flamed but i believe in time will be looked at differently
Seth when are you gonna review the nmd v2
"I sneak peeked into my presents in a big bag from my uncle and I seen an adidas box, he also said ""I got you some raw shoes"" and the box was identical to the video(all black)"
"PUMA nrgy same concept, almost rhe same looks, $40 plus delivery. Amazing  running shoe."
"I was in Japan a couple of days ago and got these sneakers. Specifically, I got the silver uppers version. The guys over at the Adidas store gave me something that looked like a can of soup. It has Adidas ISS and some japanese text all over it. Anyone got this too? I don't know what it is. The guy at the store said ""you can eat!"""
"I’m not sure how much hype is behind these, but I set my alarm to the hour and the day of release, instant cop"
"Man after just watching a few vids this channel has become my fav
Coming from the Fiverr vid!"
I want these 🔥
"They fixed the cage?!... 
Wow, they really were listening... 👌"
So true about the collaborations - Kith & AKOG are magnificent reiterations of the ub
I have these! These are my favorite pairs
I am soooooooooooooooooooooooo happy that #adidas finally decided to add some color/flavor to the BOOST Midsole! That is what this shoe desperately needed! Got both of these bad boys! in 12! Oh... Great Youtube broskie!
Bro I just came here to see if theses shoes will fit my wide a$$ foot 🙄😂
"Pretty spot on review to what you can expect when testing these out. I am debating between these and the Star Wars 19 collab. These 20s are a drip if you get your true to size. Personally enjoyed the extra 20% boost added. Feels like it’s going to last longer and still be durable in the coming years. Although as a casual wear, the 19s feel hella comfortable because of what you said, they are not as restrictive as the 20s and imo more breathable."
"If im US 9 on epic react fk 2 (perfect fit), what size should i get on ub 20 for a snug fit?"
These are really nice. I really love the ISS collab
Hey Seth I’m in DC and I believe u live here right? Well if u do is there any way that we could meet u seem like a really cool guy and just wondering if I’ll see you Black Friday shopping so ya thanks right me back if u can.
"I got these and I gotta say
They fire."
that little fray on the primeknit on the 19 was pissing me off the whole video.
Can you please review the nike epic react infinity run next? If you have them already
The silhoutte looks better than 19s but gotta see another colorway for this
noti gang 🔥🔥
"Love Your Channel, I got 2 Cop This Shoe and Try It"
They look like solar boost 2019 without the eva
"Im a size 7 1/2 wat size should I get for the ultraboost 20 ?

I had to go a half size up and get 8 for ultraboost 19 please?"
woah im not a sneaker head anymore so i stopped watching these vids. last time i saw you had 80k subs. now you got 5848k damn
you should edit in pics of the other shoes as you mention them
Its very similar to the 19’s
These shoes are 🔥 Any one know when they dropping?
The 19s looked a bit off but I grew to love them
"So I went shopping today, and I asked about this shoe, it’s supposed to come out on the 6th of December, but he let me look at them and the he “ACCIDENTALLY” sold me a pair! I love this shoe and it looks so good on feet🤫🥰"
"Tried the UB 20 in the store. Heel is too loose for me when I tried walking. Feels like the shoe is gonna come off. Is it by design, intended like that?"
What pants is he wearing? They’re sick
"Hey can someone help please..
In nike im 11 us and in my adidas eqt support 93/17 in a 10.5 us... what would be the best size for me in these can anyone help this old injured man please ha"
good looking shoes. i like the sole it’s just it looks the same and it just feels like a new color way than a new model
Nice review . The 19 had the problem that the heel part was easily hydrated when running. Maybe thats the reason they removed the  primeknit
Ultraboost is like iPhone. Nothing really changes each year.
Long time ago adidas had problem to colour boost black....now this
When I didn't have boost shoes I wanted to touch the sole
"I’m pretty sure I’m getting these for christmas
Edit: I did. I’m lovin’ them"
Looks lit🔥🔥🔥🔥
that green pixel tho
"I really enjoy the 19 model for running. I run 50-70 mpw, and I would use the 19 a lot in my shoe rotation. In terms of performance, the only thing I didn't like about the 19 was that I would get pressure points near the top of my right foot when I would run anything over 8+ miles. I hope this new model fixes that!"
Honestly Ultraboosts are the comfiest pair of shoes I've worn 10/10
"Why don't shoe brands provide intro/breakdown videos for new releases, like cell phone makers do?"
"Any thoughts on the Solar Red / Blue Violet Boost colourway dropping on the 21st? I think the vibrance of the colours makes them a 'must cop' for me, but is it TOO much colour? 🤔"
Those are 🔥🔥🔥
‘Containing your toes’
So early!
That color wey is 🔥🔥
Dang I’ll smash that shoe🤨😂
Adidas nmd v2 review please!!!
I am seeing were Brad Hall got his inspiration from
Straight up FIRE 🔥
Adidas Ultra Boost is one of my favorite sneakers!!!
"Wow, haven't bought 19 yet and they already moving on"
stoppp killing it adidas its already deaddddd! 😭😭😭⚰️
I like your reviews but how can you review a running shoes without running. you think new heel counter gives better stability but u didn't even run with it.
That faded boost 🔥
Review the Instapump Fury Boosts next!
my true to size is a 10 in Nike but in Adidas im a 9.5 in the 2 shoes i have... i dont have ultraboost
"I visited Adidas website but seems it is for US.
Does anyone know where I can find global shipping available?"
Need a pair of these when they drop! Dope U got em early 🙌
"Damn that Ultraboost 19 flopped, they completely overhauled it lol thankfully"
"""Without furthur ado"" and ""jump right into it"" is in every one of your videos as well as other YouTube channels. Those phrases should be banned. Lol just advise"
Hi seth where did you cop it please? I love the colour of the midsole its like a space galaxy tone 😍
Damn that boost looks so cool
"This Ub20 is my first ub sneakers. Yess its super comfy. Make me bought 2 more pairs ub, one more ub20 and one ub2.0 multicolor. And suprisingly i feel the ub 2.0 is more comfortable. 
Great video bro..."
Just admit defeat Adidas and keep making Ultraboost 4 colorways. The best imo
It seems like comfort is needed these days 😆 next thing people will be walking on air 🤷🏻‍♀️
"i got a problem with the tounge on my ultraboost 20 like after wearing em for a while, the tounge keeps folding over itself, anyone else got this issue or knows a way to solve it?"
"i bought these from neiman marcus beverly hills, was happy to have gotten this pair! i only own ultraboosts because of their comfort. nice video brother!"
I am getting these 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The colour is the nicest UB I’ve ever seen.
"Hehehe ""lab"" is all around hwe hwe. Thanks Seth"
You should review the Nice kick x Woodstock x consortium adidas ultraboost.They look sick!
bruh they have the same upper (nearly) as the solar boost 19
Where Can I cop them Man? Asking right from Poland
"Really like it man good review,  i wush adidas made this show in black and navey"
it sounds to me like it is encompassing the idea that the boost material is supposed to come from NASA
"Damn, this colorway reminds me of a Borderlands weapon somehow. I think its the orange details, shapes and the shiny boost."
Gonna stock up on the 19's as I really don't like the cage or the heel area on the 20's
THIS MY FAV FOR ADIDAS
I subscribed to Seth last year because of his review of the Adidas Ultra boost 19 and whenever I want to know about shoes I come back to him because he my shoe guy
Orange thing on the back puts me off... i'll wait for a Triple Black or atleast a non-collab version
"I agree with the comfort of the UB19.  For a little while in 2019, the React midsole won me over the UB4.0, but I got a heavily discounted pair of UB19 and it's my new #1 in the comfort department.  I too liked that there is more emphasis on the look of the sneaker.  Although one element I wish they changed was the heel cap.  You can easily put a cover on the heel cap, so it doesn't look so bare bones.  Just a suggestion, but for the next time you do a live stream, can you do new design concepts of the UB20?"
"Seth, congratulations on the growth of your channel! I remember viewing a yeezy on foot video and you had around 70k subs; look at you now! Keep it up 👏🏼"
"Does anyone feel the tongue hugs your foot too much, where the Adidas logo is at? The shoe is really comfortable but the tongue is my only issue."
"bruh why tho
I want them early too"
Wow your review was well done.  No detail left out
All these trainers are all good but once it rains you know you've made the mistake putting them on in the first place.
I’m really feeling these - more than the 19s for sure
An excellent new version of the ultra boost within the last days of an unforgettable decade!
They look pretty much the same as the 19 version.
"Haven’t tried them in store but ordered them online, I wanted to ask could the chrome effect scratch off and leave a black mark?"
I definitely want these Adidas Ultra boost 20s I would get them that is iridescent colourway heel it just looks soooooo cool 👌🏻😎
Can u do air force1 para-noice review?
"Their the most comfortable shoe they’ve made The 20 is the best feeling shoe. The site points out its 20 percent more give and it’s the most comfortable the stich and probably is the best shoe, I own the purple now as of a week ago. I walk around I the city with it the wealth was in the 30s and 20 degree range and my feet never got cold. It one the more beautiful looking shoes they design"
That definitely wasn't the first thing I noticed
are these like yeezys? do i need to go 1 size up?
What’s the name of the song... it’s 🔥
"The heel cup in ultraboost20 is too tight for my toe, I dont know what to do to make it less  tight 😥"
I decided I should get my first pair of ultra boosts! Which should I get ?
I love that color on the midsole
would like to have seen a solid heel cup
"Are these good for lifting? And are they good for lateral movements, I know the traction isn’t amazing but is it good as long as the bottoms are cleaned?"
I stick with my ultraboost 19 millennium falcon edition until the ultraboost 21
Now imagine the ultra boost + carbon fiber plate.
"Definitely going to pick up a pair, but not one that looks it has eye shadow. Need a cleaner colorway."
Got these for $84 on StockX. They are lit!
"i now hate the words ""collaboration"" and ""collab"""
What pants are you wearing with the shoes? They look good with those type of shoes
I just want adidas to make a THIN/sleek boost shoe
Finally adidas did something right
Just got a pair of iss same colorway love them
Try on Adidas ultraboost summer rdy review
Ayyye I got those AKOGs’
So I’ve been looking online and I can’t find any other color ways besides the I.S.S colab will there be other color ways?
Dose anyone with wide feet have these? And if so how do they fit you?
"Why even I'm watching this ??
I can't even afford basic Adidas. This will cost 50% of my  salary. Haha"
I just saw you on a poshmark ad👍
I feel the UltraBoost20s are more comfortable than the 19s tbh
the problem i've had with ultraboosts in general was the lack of support for the front toe box area after long durations of walking. Anyone with the 2020 know if these are improved?
Getting your feet in ain't easy
"Just had my 3rd ultraboost delivered. 1.0, 2.0, 20"
"Hi i just looked it up on goat and stockx and my size is available at 192 cad whereas 250 without taxes in store, how can that happen? I mean who could got them for that lower price  to sell it on stockx"
I’m a crazy normie because i want triple back 20’s to run and workout in? gooot it.
I want so much this sneaker please somebody send me
I’m getting a pair
Can you review the Air Max Plus III as an Opposite to the Ultraboost 20?
Imagine if they had the normal upper 😄
My tongue keeps folding over it's so annoying. Have to flick it up after I go down a pair of stairs
Ultraboost 2019 part2 but now it’s fire
"Back to form. I liked the 19, but the least liked boost for sure. FuryBoost OG are beautiful."
Those are fire 🔥
ordered my first pair of boost . I hope they live up to the hype
I just bought ultraboost dna shoes CNY tiger version can’t wait to wear them
So there's already 20 models of Ultraboost or there called untraboost 20s cause its already 2020?
yoo i dont think im excited for these but im kinda excited to hit 10 subs !!!!
"but the styrofoam looks cheap, like a fruit box."
if only adidas made different colored boost in 2017...
Gotta pair of 19's 4 months ago and they haven't left the box. Wanna try and trade up to get those AF1 N7 Pendleton's.
These look fire!!!
I’m definitely getting these
"I’ve always loved ultra boost I actually think they look better then the whole yeezy line but the price for the shoe that it is , is just not worth me buying 180 is steep"
"i'm a US8 on 350 V2s, what size should I go for these? Never owned an Ultraboost before."
Am I the only one that feels the ISS patch on the top of the tongue digs into my foot? Taking the insole out helps a lot but don't like the feel of the cutouts and stitching without the insole. Anyone experienced/solved this issue?
May I know your shoes' website?
They gotta stop riding the ultraboost and focus on finding a way to lower prices on the 4D🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Seth when are they releasing?
These look awesome
that colourway is so fire!
"fly boost? 
from space version?"
These are fresh on feet 🦶
$180 for these pieces of styrofoam?
Please anyone can tell me that which shoes i go for 20 or 4.0
Seth! What do you think about the Ultra Boost S/l X wing??? The last colab with Star Wars
Guys talk so many words by minutes that I just managed To pick up 1 tenth of what he says! Yeappp fact is: That guy really managed to talk more than mother in law! And that is a damn performance
this is really good plz give it to me dear i love it alot ... dear .. in pakistan
slowly merging into a NMD
"i wanted to get the ub 19,but i guess the 2.0s can hold up for some more months..."
Looks dope i hope i that they stock this at Adidas stores
Seth: this space shoe is so...spacey
How does this shoe sole compare to Yeezy 350?
When these dropping
can’t decide between 3.0s and 20s
"A-all 
D-day 
I-l 
D-dream"
Thw grail of mine.
this shoe looks perfect on jogger pants....
Those are sick!
were these released already
What ever happened to the we are underdogs videos?
I am officially intrigued
"These are fire. I was pissed about my Ultraboost orca not fitting me well, but these might be in my closet once I recover financially."
Bruh I just bought the 19s
Did this shoe come out yet my mom said Dec 5
Really wish they would release these in 4mm drops......
"I really like ultraboost especially the 20 but overtime the boost starts to flake of at least on the 4.0 
If they fixed it please let me know cuz ive been thru like 3 pairs of 4.0 thnx"
Guess I’ll have to wait 2021 to try to buy them
Once these 2020s have a triple gray colorway I'm buying
They don’t float🤨
"Ultraboost on wide feet? 
Wouldn't that hard rubber on the side hurt my wide feet?"
Favourite seth Fowler video of this year probably💪💪
These are so sick. I need
Today my first Adidas Ultraboost PB arrived .... Tomorrow a first test. Thanks for this review.
Lowkey the 20 look fresh asf
"This is ""ART""...... OMGGGGGGGG"
i love adidas shoe but i dont like the the tongue of the shoe i cant put my feet in the shoe. :(
Y’all see the green thing on some frames right
Love all the collabs keep doing them forever Adidas do the witcher series and some cyberpunk 2077 would be sick. Also playstation edition would be cool like how Van's did nintendo.
"I got these shoes for running, they are the best!"
They are pretty fire. Inching closer and closer to Yeezys. I mean they hold no candle to my Static Black V2's but I would still cop the hell out of them.
Hi is this the same fit as the ub 19? Thanks
Can you please do a video on ultraboost all tereain shoes? For some reason no one reviewed it.
"Im really glad they changed the look from the 19. 
I didn’t buy the UB19 because they just look awful.
Very nice that they changed the look"
"Should've make a new Boost blend to make them lighter. Compared to my Rincon, boost shoes is like having your feet chained to the ground."
Still love the 4.0s but these are quite a lot better looking than the 19s
Maybe if fear of god gets a collab with yltraboost it could bring the hype back but thats a long reach
Is the same confort at ultraboost S&L?
"who wanna cop this?
Me:cop"
I dig it but the 4.0 is still my favorite
Are they going to bring out an Ultraboost Laceless version.  That seemed to skip the Ultraboost19 update
"Make the Ultraboost great again....or release more 1.0 restocks, and new colorways"
in ultra boost 19 i was wearing it on 10.5 US should i go half size up in the new one like 11 US ?
"Why do they keep blurring the Torsion bar on the sole in their promotional photos??


Edit: I bought a pair. It's actually like that. It uses a clouded plastic in the torsion bar."
The problem with the 19 was your foot was’t held in place. The 19 also made my foot slide and press on the seem of sole and upper when making sharp turns and quick movements.
But could you pull it off as a lifestyle sneaker?
Anyone know what the background music is?
More of the same... yawn
I might be in the minority here but IDC. I'm a fan of the UB 19's so I'm definitely coppin these. Really digging the midsole; looks like anodized steel.
Does the midsole coating crack with wear?
hey im the first comment lol
This is so fire gonna have to cop
What’s wrong with wanting a sneaker to run in? :(
Just gunna keep my 19s
Iss reminds me of being in iss 15 times last year in 8th grade
"My heart- I want this
My bank account- haha
My wallet -haha"
Adidas must have sacked their whole design team and brought in some young blood cos these look decent. Dope on feet but I shall shleep.
i fel like they got less classic over the years
No Yeezy Stone review?
"Eh, I honestly prefer the 19 look better."
The boost is lit. The cage on the other hand is doo doo
sick!
That's the best colourway I've ever seen.
They are still years away from the peg turbos Adidas need something new. Stopped using them years ago
they need to retro some more 1.0s
"A- All
D- Day
I- I
D- Dream"
They are so dope the collab is everything
We have these where I work and they are sooooo sexy
Got that chameleon boost!
"idk why but i don’t like the cage on these, the older ones are better"
0:08 song name??
If only I had the money 😭
"Meh, looks like cheap ass Kohl's specials"
Bought it somedays ago really awesome shoes.
Oh my god that boost is GORGEOUS
"I still don't think this will be enough to bounce back from the UB '19 debacle, but at least it's a step in the right direction."
Does the shoes comes with the aluminium looking box?
Still like the older ones. The color way is great but the heel cup and stripes panel need to be changed.
"I got a pair of 19s not too long ago, as someone who was looking for comfort, I’ll stick with the 19s"
EARLY SQUAD WHERE U AT🔥
"Hi Seth, does the paint on the soles crack?  Read some reviews the blue/violet paint cracks. Anyway bought mine yesterday for 57£ or 72$. Adidas had easter monday sale. Also got the size for kids. 😁"
I enjoyed the review.  It was not clear to me when the shoe will be released.  I checked Adidas website and I did not see the shoe at all. Do you know when it will be released? Thanks
"Can someone please show me where to buy pants like he has in the thumbnail, with the cuffed bottom? They're hard to find!"
These shoes look sick Adidas definitely Up there game with there shoes
When did these even come out?
so comfy.  I recommend for any one
I wish they used these colors but stayed with the old caged ultraboost style like the ultra boost 4.0.
"I bought the all white ones, with the blue, purple, color for the adidas stripes"
Just bought mine for 80 bucks. Can't wait to get em
"The only thing the world needs 
HYPEBEAST ASTRONAUTS😐😐"
I want a 19.5. The Ultraboost 19 with the Ultraboost 20 cage.
Do the review about Ultraboost and the neighbourhood collab
Damn that colourway is cleannn
"Meh, looks too much like a 19"
I wonder what the boost is gonna look like when dirty
Anyone else saw that green spot during the on feet shots and thought it was your phone?
I love the blue boost. I've alway wanted to see a different color of boost besides black and white.
Oh yes. OH YESSS
For me a good looking shoes are the shoes that make my whole outfits look good not the ones with unique colors but ruin the whole set. No matter what it looks. The final question is is it good to go with your clothing?
"They're sick, got no Ultraboosts yet, so these will be picked up for sure!"
Universal works Ultraboost 19 or Ultraboost 20?
Is the sole removable? I have feet orthosis so thats why i'm wondering.
Omfg I love ultra boost so much just can’t afford it tho
They look the same as the 19s
I really love the new look of Ultra Boost.I think this 20 is better performance and over all style👌
Instacops!
Adidas makes the best shoes.
From what I’ve seen the blue midsole color scratches off easy to show white underneath. Anybody see this as well?
I really like them but well...
These are delicious. 19 weren't for me but I fwt
seth you always say that sneaker looks bad but when you get the sneaker then you say that this shit is good
brand name for the joggers?
Rewiew the nmd r1 v2...
What makes them so expensive £160 in the uk
I thought the couldn't add color to the mid sole?
it can jump you high right?
Love it 😍
Does it give you wings?
"Hy Seth big fans of yours, btw Can you do the review of NiKe  x PEACEMINUSONE? I really wanted to see them close, cos I'm never gonna afford it.. 😂"
I WISH they would let us have the ISS tag on the normal colorways like the all black
The boost looks so satisfying.
Love the Star Wars collab
Imagine putting foam under your shoe
I have them they costed 180$
i would 💯 procent buy em if they didn't have that ugly thing on the back. it kist looks wierd
anyone know what pants he was wearing with them?
Nike react technology is one of the best so far..and that boost just try to kick in the side of the shoe and it will remain small hole in that boost so what we speak here. BTW I like the color of the new boost is dope but yea..
"I like the shoe, but I think the cage/line on the heel needs a little purple or shade of darker blue or pink/orange or something. It can look better than just the black/black/blueish-purple"
These are fire... copped a couple days ago
UB 20 looks like a xplr with boost.
HOL UP! Those are kinda fresh doe 😳😳😳😳
Has someone the id on the Palace Hoody?
I never tried Adidas only because I thought they were ugly. I have always liked nike for it's design. But damn when I got my first pair of Yeezy with boost inside it I realized these are the comfortable shoes ever period.
Would these be good gym shoes?
"How is the mushy boost?
And does the upper have much give?"
Although not as appealing to the eyes as a 1.0 through 4.0 definitely a lot better than the 19 that I wouldn't have bought for nothing but I'm already looking forward to buying a pair of the twenties I quite like them
"They are dope.  The best looking ultra boost so far.
I will be coping them asap"
"Hi Seth,isit just me that the boost 20 is harder than 19? I felt that ub 20 is hard and not comfortable"
THESE ARE SOO DOPE
Got my best friend a pair of these
"You missed how the cage is connected better and higher to the heel support/cup than the 19, I think it looks better the way the 20s are. Not calling you out or anything , it's just one of the main reasons I didn't get the 19s. They remind me of how the Ultraboost ST early models were connected"
Felt same way hated the 19 over the 4.0 but loved then after putting the star wars editions on. Either way ultraboost best shoe ever made imo (comfort wise) I never want to wear anything else. 20 looks sick tho a mix between 19 and the .0 models.
Just bought some today for 200 shit looks fire af
No sir. It's a comofrtable descending shoe that gets worse as you wear it. React doesn't have that issue and it's more durable through time.
🔥🔥🔥
"I just got the Ultraboost 19 from adidas website for 40% off. Quite happy with it.

The boost is slightly thicker."
copped some on stock x for $140
Bruh i need those
Damn these are so fire
10:00 That's what I want.
Those look dope
You forgot to mention the best change. The cage is symmetrical and not like a trapezoid.
The mid foot cage on the 4.0 looked way better than the ones on the 19 and the 20 smh
can u do the s&ls next pls
most comfortable shoe ever
Who want a pair early for some premium hmu
Tbh liked the two tone knit with the cross stitching at the midfoot section better on the 19s. Maybe it does not come through yet on this all black cw of the 20s and we need to wait for a lighter cw to see some contrast on the primeknit.
I want to like this line of shoes but the ankle/heel piece sticks up and out when wearing the shoe and it looks stupid.
Not a fan of adidas Sneakers but I really dig those . 180€ is expensive
The upper looks kinda like the pureboosts
Ever since the ultra boost 3.0 they ruined these!
DAM I like that color way a lot!
"Their better than the 19s tbh, they seem to bring back the cleanliness of the 4.0's"
The boost like the oil spill.
The orange ones??? THE BEST
If I wear a usual 9.5 to 10.5 depending on shoe what should I get in this?
You got small feet though
Imagine if it was white and have that bottom!
"Best shoe on the market until you realise the ""continental"" rubber strip is already worn and the boost material has cracked causing you to squeak all the way to the shops! For €200 I would expect a more durable sole. Doesn't look like these have changed at all. Shame."
Where did u cop them ? Did they drop already ?
Why are they making them look so plain the older generation at least stood out
Got em for way less than $180
that color on the boost is a definite cop
Why is your beard an other color
those shoe is for running?
I like them but I wish the boost came in red
"I really want the FoG purple iridescent jacket and/or shorts with this, unfortunately those are stupid expensive"
These are nice. The 4.0’s look better though
🔥 🔥
But do they make you float
do you water proof these?
Mabuhay Seth👍🇵🇭
I was gonna get those but they’re 250 and I just got the nmds for 170
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is it over with laceless models?
Guy's am looking for a steal deal for 100$. Where can i get them? And also which one's. Thanks in advance.
First ultra boost's I am coping these are FIRE
Will the boost loose color or chip the color if I happen to rub it against the sidewalk?
I just got the 19s ☹
The Jordan 8 aqua ultraboosts
"Too many ads, it's a pair of sneakers. It's all I want to see.. Unsubscribed, not being picking. But way to many ads on all videos 🙄 one ad per video is fair enough. I know how it all works."
so 19's should go on sale now
Sweet Shoes Seth Fowler
Review pusha t ozweego plz
I am not sure if you said it but when can you get them?
Theyre beautiful
Can you do a giveaway
What's the difference between GR and GS sneakers?
"Looks ok , boost actually a pretty cool color"
Are they good with winter?
are ultra boosts cars now? every year a new model comes out.
19 < 20
"There should be two new colours: 1) black navey
2) white and cream
3) dark green black 
4) dark grey brown "
The best sneakers in the world
juz got my ub19 and than these gotta show up… 🙄
These are the best Adidas sneakers in 2020 and 19.
BRUH WTF I JUST BOUGHT THE UB 19
That sole tho
"Not first big change they made ultra boost uncaged, ATR, new atr’s that game out last year, and now 19 and 20’s"
Omg😍😍😍
ID on that palace hoodie?
I think they should come up with a subline of ultraboost that brings aesthetics back to the shoe. When I saw the 4.0 I hated it due to the wack knit pattern but then the 19s came out and it was over for me. As dope and comfortable as these are they just aren't what the ultraboost audience is looking for. Plus most runners would not go to ultraboost for running.
It’s a cool shoe but I wouldn’t wear it
Checks over Stripes. #AdidassDead
19 most comfortable and stylish
Pants. What kind of pants are those ?!
How's the fit
why do all your shoes look a half size too big?
These would look good in triple black
They’re getting uglier and uglier. I have 3 pairs and I stopped buying when 19’s came out. 🤦‍♀️
These look a lot like the solarboost
for $180.00 really need a thicker rubber sole.  really cheap thin layer of rubber.
went with the UB19's tripple black instead.
Is it just me or did the boost color copy the Nike lazer Fuchia colorway they had on the vapormax utility
🤔🤔🤔 i probably gonna get this because car  is blue so yea ...
What's the price ?
Thanks for the video seth
The most important thing for one shoe is to be SOFT INSIDE AND NOT LIKE YOU WALK IN STONES
Do these fit the same as the 4.0s???
Actually can you tell us what you actually like.. actually
Baubax shoes who?
"I love these got the pair without the colored midsole and the iridescent stripes, mainly because I’m scared of the paint chipping. Great design and it’s more or less the 18+19 having a child"
Cage is still wack
Just picked these up today. They’re my first ultraboost and got sz 10 but feel like they’re a bit tight in the toe area. Do they stretch over time or should I go a size up?
"Midsole Color is FLAMES, I just copped"
I would like an ultraboost 20 with an all white upper then that galactic boost
i want these shoes so badddddddddddddddddddddd 😫
Really??? I just bought the Ultraboost 19. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
"So they took the Solarboost 19 Upper and added a new cage and the UB 19 heel cup. I'm glad since though I really liked the look of the UB 19, it was uncomfortable for me because the front of the cage dug into my forefoot sides. Now that the cage front is angled again like the previous UB versions, this shouldn't be an issue for me anymore."
Seth. As it's a approaching black Friday. Adidas have a lot of the ultraboost 19 on discount. Should I get the 19 or is it better to wait for 20 series to come out here in the UK?
I've never wanted a pair of shoes so bad before
Still only wear the og designs
Expensive
Where can I get that 2020 shoe and what’s it called
Where’s ultra boost 3000
Which looks better: the UB 2.0 or the UB 19?
my friend has these
Just order a pair. They sick
Is the shoe supposed to have white glue in the crevices near the bottom?
"Love this new look! But what they doin making everything tighter and smaller? If you’re going to do that then make larger sizes to make up for it. Makes no sense at all! I wear a 14 in the original and fits perfect. 19 comes out had to size up to 15 until they stopped making a 15. So now this one is even tighter than the 19??? Glad all that complaining helped with adidas. They worry too much about shaving ounces and making it fit more snug, instead of make sizes to make up for these changes."
How do you clean the colored boost because I know with white boost you can use those sharpies
those who tryna cop WAIT! it will go down in price before the end of next year
"The mid cage was by far the worst part of the 19s.  I am so glad they updated it to be angled in the front, looks really good. Those colors are sick."
So you prefer the heel support of the 20 but overall the 19 is more comfortable. Is the heel more comfortable in the 20 or in the 19 then?
"The DNA fits hits the heel way better than the 20, and it also looks better. 
The 20's was too loose at the heel even though their design was supposed to remedy that."
"Hey Seth. Today all boost sneakers are on sale (at least in EU) and i couldnt decide what model to buy. Ultraboost, sense, pure, solar.. Maybe you could do a comparison between them for people not so familiar with the brand. Tried to find a easy video guide for it, but there is nothing up to date"
I like em tbh...    they look fire
I got these early and they are straight flames
Sup skanks
"Overmarketed, if that's a word."
These are ugly. The 19 have a clean look. Bring on the sales
This looks like adidas tried to copy a sketchers ripoff of the ultra boost 19s
I love adidas ultraboost but i am not inpressed.
"I love mine, but got the white ones...big mistake....they are filthy from where the rower straps cross them. I'm so sad."
"the midsole colouring is too much but overall its an improvement on the 19s, not sure i get how people like the 2020s but hate the 19s tho, they look basically the same"
"Hi Seth, did you feel the ultraboost 20 is kind of high to the ground just like the 19 version? The boost midsole stays the same with 20% more ""boost"" might cause some unbalance, dont you think? :)"
Galaxy ultra boost? Foam pososites
Should I get these or the 2.0
These look insanely nice but man they are way too expensive.
🔥
"I think ultraboosts are better colored, no more yellowing and repainting."
Foam lmao
Whats up Seth Fowler I’m everybody
The mid cage of the 19 is a humid  collector ... You can get a cup of water out of it every 5 hours
"Hey Seth, do you think ultraboost 19/20 is more or less comfortable than yeezy 350? I think I prefer yeezy for comfort but curious what you think?"
Why does seths music sound like a Minecraft remix
I hope that the color on the midsole is not going to come off easily cuz i really want to buy this pair
Let’s get Seth to 600k
Just got a pair for $170 aud as it was down from 260 and they are the comfiest shoes I’ve ever worn
"adidas Ultraboost Undefeated Schuh, 10,2 cm, Schwarz (schwarz/weiß), 39 EU 

https://amzn.to/2Ykf0MP"
ULTRABOOST 20 | Doppler
The cage on the 20 looks better because the ends are parallel to the Adidas stripes like all of the older models. No idea why they went with that trapezoid shape on the 19.
"I ended up selling all the Ultraboost I ever bought, purely because I know now how bad they actually are for your feet. A raised heel, comfort which isn't needed for human feet, and a pointed toe box which don't let your toes splay naturally as they truly should. No thanks Adidas."
Did not here about them
I like ehm but i wont cop ehm....
Just got the orange one 😁
"What’s the difference between Boost, UltraBoost, and AlphaBoost?"
Petition for adidas to make ultra boost like slides
that boost tho
Half off and I'll cop
BoostGod has left the chat.
International Scam Station
Can we just go back to the old silhouette. Ultraboost 1-4 I could only wish 😞
Adidas listened! Glad the ugly cage only lasted 1 year!
🥵🔥🔥
I have a question. Whats the difference of NMD R1 2020 and Ultra Boost 2020 they both look the same to me except the ultra boost has like a gel thing square?
That candy paint looks fresh
These are SEXY
Does it make you taller
"don't like how they keep the outsole color throughout the whole series, would be nice to see more of the outsole color, cuz not many colors are matching with this crazy metallic blue, in addition, the color would look like a mess when the shoes get dirtier"
"Black or white?
🤔"
The 20s are more stiff they suck.
How many child slaves worked on these shoes?
The midsole is atrocious. Hard pass from me.
😫👌👌👌👌👌👌👌🔥🔥🔥🔥
Adidas are some cheap as Shoes
I think I’ll pass
Раша нагибатора)))
Subtle differences make these so much better then the 19 and the midsole is fire.
"Please stop saying the 1.0-4.0 were ever a performance sneaker lol. They only said that to justify the crazy price. The 19 and 20 are actual performance sneakers, and I really think they look better without that ugly fuzzy sweater primeknit the 3.0 and 4.0 had."
You're like the HardwareCanucks of the shoe game
"I got a pair, and the junior ones in these color way is a little bit different"
those are straight fire
Seth I agree with you... I love ultraboost 1 to 4 and hated the look of 19. The first time I saw this shoe I fell in love. This is what 19 was supposed to look like. I honestly think this is the best ultraboost ever.
Review the  CNY ultra boost 2020 another 2020 pair but better color ways
Same sh*t different year.
they ruined the ultraboost with the 19 and 20
i love ultraboost 19 maybe bcoz i like techwear
Mine don’t have a orange line on
Not a fan of those colors but I like the design. Looking forward to the triple black (and hopefully a real triple grey)
Alita Berserker vibes...WANT.
The nmd r1 looks better.
I got those
Bruh 2020 are clean af
These or triple black?
Hey guys what do you think is the best color way?!
"These look sick, much better than last year"
2020 definitely a return to form. looking forward to some good colorways next year
7 Years Of Ultraboost
I’m usually all Nike but these are so nice and comfortable. Don’t tell Nike 🤫
Definitely buying.
The grey ones are sick.
Kind of tacky...Just make the boost black for all colorways
"What I don't like about the 20s is that they are a LOT nicer looking than the 19s...which mans more hypebeasts will like them, which means prices will stay higher for longer and that it will be a while before we see them at the sub $90 mark. Damn you hypebeasts!"
Not feeling that midsole color.
💯% 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🇧🇷
The ultra boost 2020 looks fake in a way
I don’t like really like adidas and never owned a pair but I’m loving those black pair... I’ll probably get a pair if I’m able to unless these dumbass resellers buy them and resell over $300
There fire
In real life the sole looks bad
Early
Last two years ultraboost have been getting uglier
The black and white scratch Ultraboost 20's are sick. I'm getting them this summer.
Just got a pair👌
Ngl didn’t even know these existed but there heat
Aqua 8 ultra boosts
Subtle but nice changes
These look so much better than the 2019 version. The mid foot cage is such an improvement. Maybe when it goes on sale I will pick it up for gym wear. Can’t see myself wearing it anywhere else tho.
Its midsole is not the same as ultraboost 19. Adidas says its heel is 22 mm and forefoot 12 mm. Thats a decrease from 29 mm heel.
Can I swap out the insoles for like sofsole for the ultraboost 20
Why did they have to make the out sole reflectively marbly flashy... plain black or plain white....
Straight fuego
Do an Ultraboost 20 vs 380 comfort video
I have solar boost 16 m
I so want a pair
MUST COP
Sweet
must cop over any discounted UB19s
Я здесь единственный русский
"Sooooooooooooooooo fresh 

Rip ultra boost 19"
That is why the three stripes are the best
Clean!
Can't believe they made new ultraboosts THAT bland... If not for boost it would look like any other cheap adidas sneaker that ppl who don't care about sneakers buy for working out
i have to  cop em
This is fire
Shoes look good but I like the 1-4 UB models better . Anyway to know if a UB 5 is coming ? Or is this 19-20-21-22 etc going to be the only Ultraboosts silhouette coming out ?? If anybody knows please msg me thanks!
SETH FOWLER please do a Jeremy Scott x Adidas review I want to see Adidas’ history in your hands
Wow
clears throat
"i have 19s and i dont know why people hate it ss much vs the first 4. the new heel lock and cage arent really a big deal to me at least. the 20s really dont seem like too big a change. i ran a lot in my 19s, and i like how they feel, but i havent tried any newer or older ones."
Going to get the black ones with the white midsole first Christmas
"got the 19 for £62.98 on Adidas' website for black Friday. Ofc I wish I could have waited for the 20 but it just wouldn't have been anywhere near as cheap and at the end of the day, I'm buying this comfort and not style. Maybe I'll sell the 19 at a profit and put it towards the 20"
I bought 3 different pairs of 19s I loved them so much. Might have to pick these up too
"I don't get the hate for Ultra Boost 19, I easily prefer it over the OG UB (which I also like), and it's my favorite sneaker of 2019, I like the look and the comfort is unbeatable. Definitelly will be copping UB 20 as well"
The ultraboost 20 looks way better than the 19 in my opinion
What is the point of the orange piece on the bottom of the shoe? Some girl I know keeps asking me and shit is getting annoying
"I’m a big fan of the UB19 and prefer performance and looks over the prior models. I’m a runner and utilize the UB19 in my rotation for the slow pace recovery runs and when it’s cold out. For speed work and uptempo runs, I look to other shoes however. The prime knit material does a great job to moderate temps and my feet don’t get cold. coldest temp I’ve ran in was lower 30s. The UB19 is hands down the best shoes when my feet and legs are sore after a long run or when I know I would be on my feet for a long time. It’s definitely my travel shoe. I’m looking forward to trying out the UB20."
"Question I have is: What's up with these weirdos that hate on the 19's but like these? If it's the midsole then I get it. But some of these people are like "" Ooh the cage on the 19's are trash but the 20's is 🔥 hurr"". In terms of looks, these and the 19's are practically identical people. Quit liking things people tell you to like and disliking things people tell you to dislike. Cudas, I swear."
🤔💬……🙅🏻‍♂️👟😅
"Awesome 
Great video"
I kinda liked the 19's more..... Don't judge me.
Dead shoe
awesome video!
those are hot af
Damn these are sexy. But im a fat dude who doesnt have clothes to match these shoes. I wear the same 2 to 3 t shirts when i get home from work. I have a very simple closet. And i only have 2 pairs of nike shoes
i haaaaaaaaaaaaate that boost color
sorry but yeezy slides are the comfiest footwear ever conceived
Those are fire
I know people are gonna hate just like with the 19s but yoooo that midsole is so sick. Gonna have to cop a pair fosho
looks like shoes
Sorry for u being bench today
I prefer the 19
BRUH MINE DONT HAVE THE ORANGE ON THE BACK ARE THEY FAKE?
Any ultra boost is the most comfy sneaker you can get till date like no cap I have never wanted to take them off because my feet were uncomfortable. I only ever switched them up cuz otherwise people gonna think I am crazy lmao
nahh
So much better than the 19. I can’t wait to cop these
😍😍😍
UltraSpaceJams
is it juz me or the ultraboost is getting uglier...?
"I wanted the black ones for Christmas but I got the white ones instead but I’m still grateful

Story time: my dad didn’t tell me I was going hiking and it was muddy and had to go in my white 200 dollar and I’m a sneaker head so I was pretty much on the edge of crying."
The ultra boost eqt not the updated version are BY FAR the most comfortable. Idk why youtubers pretend they don’t exist. The 19 is not the most comfortable just stop.
The midsole is ugly in this one?
"Me: adidas fights back

adidas: yes we launch the ultra boost 2020 at targets in the USA at 20:20 november 2019 western time"
GR???
"I search for EUR 44, but adidas doesn't make it and just make until size EUR 42. Why ?"
What crack head said it was a good idea to make the cage look like that ew
Another reason why Adidas is by a lot better than Nike!
samsung note 10 + bottoms
If Adidas would stop making all their boost sneakers with white midsoles  and color them like this pair or even just black myself and I'm sure a lot of other people would buy them.  The white midsoles get dirty way too quick and it's so hard to clean to get it back to the clean white like it was fresh out the box.
How much
"A: all
D: day
I:  I
D: dream"
You're always dripping hardcore
Normal 4.0 it’s better
"The midfoot cage on the 20s is much better than the 19s.  From a strictly design perspective, it's better to parallel the stripes.  From my N=1 perspective, have the extra room on the forefoot is better for wide feet."
Best color of any ultraboost sole
Какие они ахеренные
Holy moly
Are these good for boys because the violet shine makes it look a little bit more for girls
Yes so annoying that the old shape gets all the different colors and patterns and the new shape just gets boring two tone. I’ve put off getting a pair of the new shape because of this. Hopefully we’ll see some different patterns with the 20.
Would be good if it didn’t have that cheap shitty white (whatever they are called) things that makes the shoe.
Might cop the all black
I have ultraboost 19 and they are much better than that of 2020 I guess
this is the best looking UB ever!
I’ve got the all blacks
Nice shoes
you should be yeezy busta
These ultra boost have been sitting in shelf’s since it came out
"Adidas: “Hey, lets take the UltraBoost silhouette that most sneakerheads universally disliked more than the original, then make it even worse”"
Here is 36000 thousands rupees as well as only white base 🙉🙉🙉
First
they are definitely better than the 19's. but nothing will ever compare the original ultra boosts!  did you get any terrains? would love to see your review on those. I got them and I LOVE THEM!
"Adidas does everything right, and then they pop out that horrible tongue that makes the shoe feel so snug and uncomfortable throughout the day."
"i was waiting for him to u know walk 15 miles or summur, but blabbering on and on, dood, we all know it should work, show us on streets"
My first adidas shoe in YEARS can’t wait to be a cozy boi again
"Sorry, but I don't really like these things around the toe area and I prefer how the 19s colar is molded. So I'd say I prefer the UB19 silhouette, and I prefer UB20's CWs"
Puma
No more Nike’s for me
i prefer ultraboost 19
ultra boost the best
I don't know and really can't tell if seth is ginger or blonde
Cop
way better cage than the 19s
U r wearing the same hoodie for the last ultra boost review
These shoes look like a generic adidas dad shoe minus the midsole.
Way better then the 19s
Feth Sowler
Not quite feeling it but it’s a cool sneaker nonetheless
The silhouette is much better than the the 19 and less squarish on the toe box
"Used to have all these sneakers...sold them all.  Flex culture is a waste of money and time. How insecure can yall be that all that matters is how someone looks at what you wear?  If you were the last person on earth, would you still have all the shoes yall got? Probably not cuz theres no one to show them off to.  Flex culture is spending thousands if dollars to get validation from people yall dont even know."
I'm staggered that you missed the fact that the boost under the insole isn't covered like the UB19. It has the cutouts like the older Ultra Boost models (and Pure Boost)
Looks way better
Mannn...i just today bought the ultraboost 19 ....😭
I wish they make a laceless version..

"They will push the ""totally not ripped off from the nike future throwback collection"" color scheme more than nike and will claim that they made it first"

ultraboost 17 were best
Ha Normies
"Nobody- this shoe is space colored
Seth- for some reason this reminds me of space
🤔"
UltraPulse HD '19
ugly shoes not worth the money at all..
Ugly
3 >>>>>>>>> 19
The cage is not 100% my favorite but these don't make me immediately turn away like the 2019 does... nice video
Who has all blacks
"Adidas makes some of the ugliest looking shoes, also too expensive for what they bring to the table."
"I didn‘t like the UB 2019, the 2020 looks waaaaaayyyy better!"
Those are COLD 🥶 
"for me, the 20s toe box is too shallow, pressing down on the toenails. the lacing cage is too rigid, and my heel doesn't lock down. the 19s are my perfect shoe"
My personal opinion is that these are slightly better than the 19s but definitely not the best I use boost as a lifestyle shoe and I don’t like how adidas is trying to make the ultraboost something it isn’t I think it should stay the way it was before the 19s
boost is ded
This colorway is terrible
just get rid of the cage lol. thats what we all want.
"Ultraboost 1 Release a running shoe that cant be used for running for 180$
Ultraboost 20 Release a running shoe that try to focus on running but still cant be used for running for 180$
Yall know yall can get made in italy shoes for 200$ right?"
Am I really the only one who dislikes the coloured  boost?
Why real runners will never wear this because of all these hypebeasts. Adidas used to be great. but they lost their ways.  Sketcher makes better running shoes.
Didnt think they can make anything worse than the 19
Americans always pronounce ADIDAS wrong. Why is that? Its pronounced AHH-dee-dahs not ahh-DEE-dus.
It's great shoe structure design but black colorway is ugly af.
I don’t understand why people prefer the original Ultraboost over the 19’s. The originals look doofy to me and don’t come close to the 19’s at all.
